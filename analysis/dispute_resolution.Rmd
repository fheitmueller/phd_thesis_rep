## Overall analysis of taxpayer friendliness

Jurisdictions without corporate income tax as well as jurisdictions without tax treaties are not considered in the analysis, since most answers are not applicable to them. For jurisdictions without tax treaties, only the elements related to bilateral APAs, as well as coverage of foreign taxpayer adjustments could be relevant.
For other jurisdictions, if an element is not applicable because in practice no MAPs have been concluded, this is also considered as taxpayer friendly answer.
If an information is missing this is coded as not taxpayer friendly.


```{r taxpayer friendliness calculation}

tables$taxpayer_friendliness <- mapply(function(x, y) any(x %in% y), tables$response, tables$taxpayer_friendly_answers)

tables %<>% mutate(taxpayer_friendliness = case_when(
  taxpayer_friendliness == TRUE ~ 1,
  taxpayer_friendly_answers == "neutral" ~ NA_real_,
  response == "partial" ~ 0.5,
  taxpayer_friendliness == FALSE ~ 0))

write_csv(tables, here("data-created/dispute_resolution_analyzed.csv"))

```

For jurisdictions without a corporate income tax, taxpayer friendliness is not reduced if certain elements are not available. Hence I adjust their scores. This is in line with the OECD peer review reports, which for example do not mention issues for improvement in the case of Bermuda, although formally not all elements are complied with.

- All elements related to bilateral APA (APA programs are not relevant if there is no tax to be imposed in the first place)
- Access in audit settlement cases
- Suspension of tax collection (since no tax would be collected in the first place)
- Interest and penalties (since no penalties would normally be levied)
- TP corresponding adjustments (no adjustment possible since no tax is levied)
- Additional tax time frame info
- Refund time frame info

```{r adjustment for jurisdictions without income tax}
tables %<>% mutate(taxpayer_friendliness = case_when(
  comb_rate == 0 &
    new_row %in% c(2:7) ~ 1,
  TRUE ~ taxpayer_friendliness))
```

If a jurisdiction submitted two MAP Profiles in one year, only the more recent one will be considered.

```{r only consider most recent in year}
distinct_rows <- tables %>% group_by(iso3c, date) %>% add_tally() %>% ungroup() %>% select(n) %>% slice(1) %>% pull(n)
tables %<>% group_by(iso3c, year) %>% arrange(desc(date)) %>% slice(1:distinct_rows) %>% ungroup()
```

bp_score <- tables %>% filter(action_14 == "bp") %>%  group_by(iso3c, year) %>% summarize(bp_score = sum(taxpayer_friendliness, na.rm = TRUE))
