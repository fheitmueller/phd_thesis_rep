Under these rules, the tax authorities may adjust the prices applied in transactions with related parties if they consider the prices not to be in line with the arm’s-length standard. No documentation requirements are imposed under the current law. It is possible to apply for advance pricing agreements with the tax authorities.

ALB,2015,Albania,transfer pricing,"Transfer pricing. New transfer-pricing rules, which are aligned with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation (OECD) Transfer Pricing Guidelines of 2010, were introduced in June 2014. Under these rules, taxpayers engaged in controlled transactions carried out on or after 4 June 2014 and in recurring transactions continuing after that date are required for the first time to maintain transfer-pricing documentation, which must be submitted within 30 days after a request of the tax authorities. Failure to prepare transfer-pricing documentation is not sanctioned with penalties, but fulfilling such requirement protects the taxpayer from the assessment of penalties in the event of transfer pricing-related audit adjustments. Such penalties equal 5% of additional tax liability and are applied for each month of delay, capped at 25%. Only cross-border and controlled transactions are subject to the transfer-pricing rules. Consequently, domestic transactions are not subject to the rules. Controlled transactions are considered to be transactions between related parties, dealings between a permanent establishment and its head office, and transactions with an entity resident in a tax-haven jurisdiction. Two persons are considered related parties if either one of them participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of the other, or the same person(s) participate(s) directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of the two parties; that is, the same person owns 50% or more of the share capital of the other person or effectively controls the business decisions of the other person. The new rules refer to the application of the most appropriate method among the OECD transfer-pricing methods, which are comparable uncontrolled price, resale price, cost-plus, transactional net margin and profit-split. If it can be proved that none of the approved methods can be reasonably applied, taxpayers are allowed to use other more appropriate methods. Taxpayers are required to submit by 31 March of the following year a Controlled Transaction Notice, which lists the intercompany transactions and the transfer-pricing methods applied to these transactions, if their controlled transactions exceed in aggregate ALL50 million (approximately EUR357,000).

After recent court decisions questioning the Australian Tax Office’s approach to transfer-pricing administration and the interaction of Australia’s domestic transfer-pricing laws and double tax treaties, the government announced proposals to adjust Australia’s transfer-pricing legislation. The following are significant aspects of the proposals: • They will clarify that Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) transfer-pricing principles apply for certain double tax treaty purposes, effective from 2004 (draft law has been issued) . • They will apply similar OECD principles to transactions not involving tax-treaty counterparties, from a future date. On 16 March 2012, the government released an exposure draft of new transfer-pricing legislation, which is intended to clarify and confirm the Australian Tax Office’s longstanding and highly controversial view that Australia’s tax treaties provide a separate and unconstrained taxing power.

Rules that preceded the introduction of Australia’s self-assessment regime continue to be relevant for transactions before 1 July 2012. They require the Australian Tax Office to determine whether the operating provisions apply. If they do apply, the Australian Tax Office adjusts the amount of consideration for a cross-border supply or acquisition or reallocates income and expenses between a permanent establishment and other parts of the company. For transactions with parties entitled to benefit from foreign tax treaties, Australia enacted transfer-pricing rules in 2012, with application to income years beginning on or after 1 July 2004. These rules confirm the Australian Tax Office’s long-standing and highly controversial view that Australia’s tax treaties provide a separate and unconstrained transfer-pricing taxing power. The amendments also allow the use of Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) transfer-pricing guidance material.

AUS,2016,Australia,transfer pricing,"Transfer pricing. Australia’s tax law includes measures to ensure that Australian taxable income associated with cross-border transactions is based on arm’s-length prices. Several methods for determining the arm’s-length price are available. The Australian Taxation Office provides guidance in a binding tax ruling on the appropriate methods, and taxpayers can enter into Advance Pricing Arrangements. For transactions with parties entitled to benefit from foreign tax treaties, the law confirms the ATO view that Australia’s tax treaties provide a separate and unconstrained transfer pricing taxing power. The amendments also allow the use of the OECD transferpricing guidance material. For all other transactions, a new law applies to income years beginning on or after 1 July 2013, to bring the transfer-pricing rules into the self-assessment regime. It requires broader and timely documentation. The new law increases the risk of transfer-pricing adjustments, particularly for companies that are involved in significant intragroup financing arrangements or business restructurings or that have losses or low levels of profits. Significant aspects include the following: • The onus is on the Public Officer who signs the income tax return to confirm that the actual conditions are in line with arm’slength conditions.

A transfer-pricing adjustment with respect to such undocumented transactions attracts a penalty of at least 25%. The penalties are proposed to be doubled for income years beginning on or after 1 July 2015 for taxavoidance and profit-shifting schemes, with respect to groups that have global turnover of greater than AUD1 billion.

Austria has accepted the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) transfer-pricing guidelines and published a summary of the interpretation of the OECD guidelines by the Austrian tax administration in 2010. Under these guidelines, all transactions with related parties must be conducted at arm’s length. If a transaction is considered not to be at arm’s length, the transaction price is adjusted for corporate income tax purposes. This adjustment may be deem ed to be a hidden profit distribution subject to withholding tax or a capital contribution. In 2016, Austria introduced the Transfer Pricing Documentation Law (TPDL), which follows the three-tier documentation approach consisting of a Country-by-Country Report (CbCR), the master file and the local file. The master file and local file must be prepared if an Austrian constituent entity generated over EUR50 million turnover in the two preceding fiscal years. A CbCR must be prepared if the whole multinational group exceeded a threshold of consolidated turnover of EUR750 million in the preceding fiscal year. By the last day of the fiscal year for which a CbCR is prepared, each Austrian constituent entity of a multinational group exceeding the threshold must inform the competent Austrian tax office of the entity that is preparing or filing the CbCR and where this entity is a resident. An Austrian entity that does not reach the threshold for filing a master file and a local file still must file a master file if the multinational group is required to prepare one by another country. In addition, the TPDL clarifies that documentation obligations existing in addition to the TPDL (for example, accounting and filing obligations imposed by the Austrian Federal Fiscal Code [FFC]) are not affected by the TPDL. Therefore, it is strongly suggested that constituent entities resident in Austria of multinational groups that do not exceed the stipulated turnover of the TPDL prepare Transfer Pricing Documentation Reports in accordance with the FFC. The following summary is intended purely for orientation purposes; it does not reflect the various special provisions of individual treaties or the withholding tax regulations in domestic tax law.

An updated version of the Austrian transfer-pricing guidelines is currently under review.

AZE,2018,Azerbaijan,transfer pricing,"Transfer pricing. Recent legislative amendments to the Tax Code of the Republic of Azerbaijan introduced transfer-pricing rules, effective from 1 January 2017. These rules are conceptually based on the arm’s-length principle outlined in the transfer-pricing guidelines developed by Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The new rules apply to Controlled Transactions, as defined in the rules. The following are Controlled Transactions: • Transactions between residents of Azerbaijan and related parties of such residents, as defined in the Tax Code • Transactions between permanent establishments of nonresidents and such nonresidents, as well as representative offices, branches and other establishments of such nonresidents in other countries • Transactions between residents of Azerbaijan and/or permanent establishments of nonresidents in Azerbaijan and persons incorporated or registered under the laws of the jurisdictions recognized as preferential tax regime countries under the laws of Azerbaijan Controlled Transactions are subject to reporting requirements if the company’s annual turnover exceeds AZN500,000 (approximately USD294,100). Reporting is achieved through the submission of a Notification on Controlled Transactions by 31 March of the year following the reporting year. Controlled Transactions can be subject to review by the tax authorities largely based on arm’s-length principles assuming a comparability analysis under five transfer-pricing methods that are outlined in OECD transfer-pricing guidelines and recognized in local transfer-pricing rules, subject to certain specific provisions. These provisions in the local transfer-pricing rules must be considered while performing the comparability analysis. If the tax authorities make a price correction during the on-site tax audit, the additional tax accrual could be subject to 50% financial sanction. Azerbaijan currently considers none of the tax treaties of the former USSR to be in force. Azerbaijan has entered into tax treaties with various countries. The withholding rates under Azerbaijan’s ratified treaties are listed below. Because of recent reductions in domestic withholding tax rates, the tax treaties may now specify rates that are the same as, or in excess of, domestic rates and, consequently, offer little or no savings with respect to withholding taxes. The rates in the table reflect the lower of the treaty rate and the rate under domestic tax law.

BEL,2019,Belgium,transfer pricing,"Transfer pricing. The Belgian Income Tax Code (ITC) contains anti-avoidance provisions that relate to specific aspects of transfer pricing. “Abnormal and gratuitous advantages” granted by a Belgian enterprise are added to the tax base of the Belgian enterprise, unless the advantages are directly or indirectly part of the taxable income of the recipient in Belgium. The ITC also contains anti-avoidance provisions concerning royalties, interest on loans and other items, as well as a provision on the transfer of certain types of assets abroad. Under these provisions, the taxpayer must demonstrate the bona fide nature of the transaction. Multinationals must fulfill documentation requirements (Master File, Local File and Country-by-Country Reporting) for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2016. The rates in the table below reflect the lower of the treaty rate and the rate under domestic tax law on outbound dividends. Belgium provides an exemption from dividend withholding tax for companies located in countries with which Belgium has entered into a tax treaty. The exemption is subject to the same conditions as those contained in the EU Parent-Subsidiary Directive. However, the treaty must contain an exchange-of-information clause. As a result, certain countries are excluded. In reaction to the OECD’s position regarding the application of Article 26 (exchange of information) of the model convention in treaties entered into by Belgium, Belgium began renegotiating all treaties in 2009. This has resulted in more than 40 new treaties (the vast majority of which have not yet become effective). It is expected that most of these treaties will enter into effect in the upcoming years. In some cases, the negotiations are limited to the exchange of information only. For certain treaties, other articles are also included in the negotiations.

On 29 January 2019, the Brazilian tax authorities published Normative Instruction (NI) 1.870/19 to clarify the application of the Brazilian transfer-pricing rules. NI 1.870/19 applies from the 2019 calendar year. The following are summaries of the relevant changes introduced by the NI 1.870/19: • Transfer-pricing methods for commodities: goods that are simply quoted in one of the commodities exchanges listed in Appendix II of the Normative Instruction 1.312/12 are no longer considered commodities for Brazilian transfer-pricing purposes. The NI 1.870/19 also clarified that taxpayers must perform a transfer-pricing analysis on a transaction basis. Taxpayers are not allowed to group all the transactions that occurred on the same day to calculate a single actual intercompany price to be tested under the Quotation Price on Imports (PCI) method and the Quotation Price on Exports (PCEX) method. • Discrepancy margin: NI 1.870/19 clarified that the difference between the actual intercompany price and the comparable price must be calculated by considering the weighted average benchmark price differing from the actual price up to 5% for transactions carried out before 31 December 2018.

The comparable prices under the Comparable Independent Price (PIC) method and the Production Cost Plus Profit (CPL) method must be calculated exclusively in the calendar year in which the good, service or right was imported. On the other hand, the Resale Minus Profit (PRL) method calculation must be performed in the calendar year in which the imported good, service or right is sold. • PIC method: NI 1.870/19 makes clear that a PIC comparable must not be calculated by considering transactions involving parties (related or unrelated) located in countries considered to be a tax haven or privileged tax jurisdiction. • PRL method: To define the actual price for imports, taxpayers must consider the International Commercial Terms.

BRA,2021,Brazil,transfer pricing,"Transfer pricing. Brazilian transfer-pricing rules apply only to cross-border transactions entered into between Brazilian com­ panies and foreign related parties. A transaction entered into between a Brazilian company and a resident of a low-tax jurisdiction or a resident in a jurisdiction with a privileged tax regime is also subject to the transfer-pricing rules, even if the parties are not related. In general, Brazilian transfer-pricing rules do not follow the transfer-pricing guidelines outlined in the Organisation for Eco­ nomic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Model Convention and the US rules. For example, Brazilian transfer-pricing rules adopt fixed-profit margins on transactions carried out between related parties. Safe harbor measures may be applied to Brazilian exports. On 29 January 2019, the Brazilian tax authorities published Normative Instruction (NI) 1.870/19 to clarify the application of the Brazilian transfer-pricing rules. NI 1.870/19 applies from the 2019 calendar year. The following are summaries of the relevant changes introduced by the NI 1.870/19: • Transfer-pricing methods for commodities: goods that are simply quoted in one of the commodities exchanges listed in Appendix II of the Normative Instruction 1.312/12 are no longer considered commodities for Brazilian transfer-pricing purposes. The NI 1.870/19 also clarified that taxpayers must perform a transfer-pricing analysis on a transaction basis. Taxpayers are not allowed to group all the transactions that occurred on the same day to calculate a single actual intercompany price to be tested under the Quotation Price on Imports (PCI) method and the Quotation Price on Exports (PCEX) method. • Discrepancy margin: NI 1.870/19 clarified that the difference between the actual intercompany price and the comparable price must be calculated by considering the weighted average benchmark price differing from the actual price up to 5% for transactions carried out before 31 December 2018.

Companies with annual turnover excluding tax that is equal to or greater than XAF1 billion and that are under the control of or control other companies are required to present to the tax administration agents, on the date of the commencement of the accounting audit, documentation enabling them to justify the transfer-pricing policy practiced in the context of transactions of all kinds carried out with related companies.

This formal notice must indicate the sanctions applicable in the absence of a response or in the event of a partial response. Failure to respond or partial response to the formal notice mentioned above results in the application, for each audited financial year, of a fine of 5% of the amount of the transactions related to the documents or supplements that have not been made available to the administration after formal notice.

The previous Form 8 (Outbound Investment Form) is deleted. Disclosures regarding corporate income tax withheld and preferential tax treatment from the previous Form 9 (Outbound Payment Form) are removed. Disclosure requirements regarding the transfer-pricing policy are removed, as well as overseas unrelated-party names and relevant transaction volumes. Documentation structure. Bulletin 42 adopts the three-tiered documentation structure set out in the final reports under Action 13 of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Base Erosion Profit Shifting (BEPS) Action Plan. CBCR (disclosed as part of the RPT Forms) consists of a master file and a local file. In addition, special item files are required for taxpayers entering or implementing CSAs or falling under the thin-capitalization requirements. Taxpayers that meet the conditions outlined below need to prepare a master file and a local file. A master file is required if annual RPTs exceed CNY1 billion, if any cross-border RPTs occur and the entity’s ultimate parent already prepares a master file. A local file is required if RPTs during the year meet any of the following conditions: • Annual RPTs of physical goods exceed CNY200 million (in the case of toll manufacturing [toll manufacturing refers to an arrangement under which raw materials or component parts are mainly purchased in the name of a foreign principal for use by a Chinese manufacturer in the production of finished goods], the value is based on annual import and export prices for customs purposes) • Annual RPTs involving the transfer of financial assets exceed CNY100 million • Annual RPTs involving the transfer of rights to intangibles exceed CNY100 million • Annual RPTs of other types (for example, related-party service transactions, royalties for use of intangibles and related-party financing transactions) in aggregate exceed CNY40 million Taxpayers that only deal with domestic related parties can be exempted from preparing the master file, the local file and any special item file. Local files and special item files are not required for RPTs that are covered under an Advance Pricing Agreement (APA). Furthermore, the amount of these covered transactions is not included when calculating local file thresholds. Bulletin 42 provides that resident enterprises that meet one of the following criteria should submit CBCR: • The resident enterprise is the ultimate holding company of the multinational enterprise group, and total revenue of all kinds from the last fiscal year’s consolidated financial statement was over CNY5,500,000. • The resident enterprise is designated to submit CBCR by the multinational enterprise group. If multinational enterprises are required to prepare CBCR according to relevant provisions of other countries’ laws, the Chinese tax authorities can ask for CBCR from the Chinese subsidiaries when undertaking a special tax investigation under the following circumstances: • The multinational enterprise has not submitted a CBCR to any country. • The multinational enterprise has submitted a CBCR to another country, but China has not established an Information Exchange Mechanism with the country. • The multinational enterprise has submitted a CBCR to another country, and China has established an Information Exchange Mechanism with that country, but CBCR has not in fact been exchanged with China. Bulletin 42 stipulates the deadline for the master file is 12 months after the close of the financial year of the ultimate parent company; the deadline for the local file and any special item file is 30 June of the year following the close of the taxpayer’s year.

It is noteworthy that extensive interactions between the taxpayer and the tax authorities occur well before the APA application is formally accepted. Taxpayers must be prepared to perform significant analysis and provide extensive documentation during the process. Bulletin 64 makes numerous references to the analysis of the value chain and of Location Specific Advantages (LSAs), such as location savings and market premiums. This is in keeping with the contemporaneous documentation requirements that the SAT put in place under Bulletin 42.

Bulletin 42 provides that contemporaneous documentation should be submitted to the tax authorities within 30 days on the request of the tax authorities. Taxpayers may apply for APAs in China. An APA is an agreement between a taxpayer and one or more tax authorities regarding how transfer prices will be calculated in the future. Effective from 1 December 2016, SAT Bulletin Gonggao [2016] No. 64 (Bul­ letin 64) governs the administration of APAs in China. The APA process has the following six steps: • Pre-filing meeting • Intention discussion • Analysis and evaluation • Formal application • Negotiation and conclusion of the arrangement • Execution monitoring In contrast to Circular 2, Bulletin 64 does not allow the pre-filing meeting to be anonymous and does not specify the time periods between each of the steps. It is noteworthy that extensive interactions between the taxpayer and the tax authorities occur well before the APA application is formally accepted. Taxpayers must be prepared to perform significant analysis and provide extensive documentation during the process. Bulletin 64 makes numerous references to the analysis of the value chain and of Location Specific Advantages (LSAs), such as location savings and market premiums. This is in keeping with the contemporaneous documentation requirements that the SAT put in place under Bulletin 42. Bulletin 64 provides that the role of LSAs is one of the topics for discussion at pre-filing meetings. Both value-chain analysis and analysis of LSAs are required elements of the draft application materials submitted before the intention discussion. On 17 March 2017, the SAT issued SAT Bulletin [2017] No. 6 (Bulletin 6), “Supervisory Measures for Special Tax Investigation Adjustments and Mutual Agreement Procedures.” Bulletin 6 entered into force on 1 May 2017. Bulletin 6 contains long-awaited guidance on the application of the arm’s-length principle, including guidance with respect to intangible property transactions, intercompany service transactions, location-specific advantages, transfer-pricing methods and various procedural matters. Detailed guidance on mutual agreement procedures (MAPs) under double taxation treaties is provided. Bulletin 6 reflects the importance that the SAT places on double taxation treaties and on the international consensus that has developed over the course of the BEPS project led by the OECD.

China has introduced transfer-pricing rules under which all amounts paid or charged in business transactions between related parties must be determined based on an arm’s-length standard. If the parties fail to meet this requirement, the tax bureau may make reasonable adjustments by using one of the following methods: • Comparable uncontrolled price (CUP) • Resale price method (RPM) • Cost-plus method (CPM) • Transactional net margin method (TNMM) • Profit split method (PSM) • Other methods, including asset valuation methods, such as the cost-based method, market-based method and income-based method, and other methods that are consistent with the arm’slength principle On 29 June 2016, the State Administration of Taxation (SAT) issued SAT Notice [2016] No. 42 (Bul­letin 42), replacing the following items of 2009’s Implemen­tation Measures for Special Tax Adjustments (Trial Version; Guoshuifa [2009] No. 2 (Circular 2): • Chapter 2: Related-Party Transaction (RPT) Reporting • Chapter 3: Documentation Requirements • Article 74: Cost Sharing Agreements (CSAs) Documentation • Article 89: Thin Capitalization Documentation It also replaced the Annual RPT Forms of Enterprises of the People’s Republic of China (Guoshuifa [2008] No. 114), governing RPT disclosure in annual income tax filings. The provisions in Bulletin 42 apply for the 2016 fiscal year and thereafter. Chinese enterprises must disclose RPTs in RPT forms, which should be submitted to the in-charge tax bureau together with the annual tax return by the due date for the annual return (that is, before 31 May of the following year). Bulletin 42 replaces Circular Guoshuifa [2008] No. 114 and introduces significant new disclosure requirements with respect to RPTs. The major changes introduced by Bul­letin 42 are describ­ ed below.

Bulletin 42 adopts the three-tiered documentation structure set out in the final reports under Action 13 of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Base Erosion Profit Shifting (BEPS) Action Plan. This structure consists of a CbCR (disclosed as part of the RPT Forms), a Master File and a Local File. In addition, special item files are required for taxpayers entering or implementing CSAs or falling under the thin-capitalization requirements. Taxpayers that meet the conditions outlined below need to prepare a Master File and a Local File. A Master File is required if annual RPTs exceed CNY1 billion, or if any cross-border RPTs occur and the entity’s ultimate parent already prepares a Master File. A Local File is required if RPTs during the year meet any of the following conditions: • Annual RPTs of physical goods exceed CNY200 million (in the case of toll manufacturing [toll manufacturing refers to an arrangement under which raw materials or component parts are mainly purchased in the name of a foreign principal for use by a Chinese manufacturer in the production of finished goods], the value is based on annual import and export prices for customs purposes) • Annual RPTs involving the transfer of financial assets exceed CNY100 million • Annual RPTs involving the transfer of rights to intangibles exceed CNY100 million • Annual RPTs of other types (for example, related-party service transactions, royalties for use of intangibles and related-party financing transactions) in aggregate exceed CNY40 million Taxpayers that only deal with domestic related parties can be exempted from preparing the Master File, the Local File and any special item file. Local Files and special item files are not required for RPTs that are covered under an Advance Pricing Agreement (APA). Further­ more, the amount of these covered transactions is not included when calculating Local File thresholds. Bulletin 42 provides that resident enterprises that meet one of the following criteria should submit CbCR: • The resident enterprise is the ultimate parent company of the multinational enterprise group, and total revenue of all kinds from the last fiscal year’s consolidated financial statement was over CNY5,500,000,000. • The resident enterprise is designated to submit CbCR by the multinational enterprise group. If multinational enterprises are required to prepare CbCR according to relevant provisions of other countries’ laws, the Chinese tax authorities can ask for CbCR from the Chinese subsidiaries when undertaking a special tax investigation under the following circumstances: • The multinational enterprise has not submitted a CbCR to any country. • The multinational enterprise has submitted a CbCR to another country, but China has not established an Information Exchange Mechanism with the country. • The multinational enterprise has submitted a CbCR to another country, and China has established an Information Exchange Mechanism with that country, but CbCR has not in fact been successfully exchanged with China.

A company may apply one of the following methods for establishing an arm’s-length price: • Comparable uncontrolled price method • Resale price method • Cost-plus method • Profit-split method • Transactional net margin method Under the Croatian excessive interest rate rule, the deduction of interest on a loan received by a Croatian taxpayer from a related party is limited to a maximum deductible interest rate published by the Croatian Minister of Finance before the beginning of the relevant tax year (3.42% per year for 2020 and 3% per year for 2021). The abovementioned interest rate is calculated as the average of the interest rates on the outstanding balances of loans that are granted for a period longer than one year to nonfinancial companies and that are published by the Croatian National Bank in the current calendar year. Instead of the rate prescribed by the Minister of Finance, taxpayers can apply the abovementioned transfer pricing methods for establishing an arm’s-length interest rate, subject to the condition that such method apply to all agreements. Taxpayers can enter into an agreement in the area of transfer pricing and contractual relations between related companies with the Croatian tax authorities and tax authorities in other jurisdictions if applicable (resident jurisdictions of related companies or permanent establishments through which the business activities are carried out). Advance pricing agreements (APAs) enable parties to determine a set of criteria for determining transfer prices (for example, methods, adjustments and key assumptions) before beginning related-party transactions during a tax period.",2393,FALSE,yes,yes,High income,1,0

In general, transfer-pricing rules in Ecuador follow Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) rules, because they require fulfillment of the arm’s-length standard. Nevertheless, the technical preferences of the IRS are quite specific and may imply significant differences when measuring compliance with the rules. Special rules apply to oil, bananas and metallic commodities. In addition to traditional ownership-control criteria to determine relationships between parties, since 2008, the law considers companies related if they are domiciled in foreign jurisdictions listed as tax havens by the IRS (86 jurisdictions) or if they are paying anywhere else a corporate income tax deemed as “low” by the IRS (as of 2017, the threshold is 13.2%). Transfer-pricing information must be documented by all companies having transactions with related parties, including domestic ones. Companies must file their documentation with the IRS if certain conditions are met, as described below. Income taxpayers that have carried out transactions with related parties during a fiscal year in an amount exceeding USD3 million must submit the Transfer Pricing Annex to the IRS.

EGY,2018,Egypt,transfer pricing,"Transfer pricing. The Egyptian tax law contains measures regarding transfer pricing, which are based on the arm’s-length principle. Under these measures, the tax authorities may adjust the income of an enterprise if its taxable income in Egypt is reduced as a result of contractual provisions that differ from those that would be agreed to by unrelated parties. However, under the new tax law, it is possible to enter into arrangements in advance with the tax de partment regarding a transfer-pricing policy (Advance Pricing Arrange ment). An Advance Pricing Arrangement ensures that transfer prices will not be challenged after the tax return is submitted and, accordingly, eliminates exposure to penalties and interest on the late payment of taxes resulting from adjustments of transfer prices. The Egyptian Tax Department, in association with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, has issued transferpricing guidelines. The guidelines provide taxpayers with guidance on the application of the arm’s-length principle to the pricing of their intra-group transactions, as well as outlining the documentation taxpayers must maintain to demonstrate their compliance with this principle. The table below sets forth maximum withholding rates provided in Egypt’s double tax treaties for dividends, interest and royalties.

An APA ensures that transfer prices will not be challenged after the tax return is submitted and, accordingly, eliminates exposure to penalties and interest on the late payment of taxes resulting from adjustments of transfer prices. The Egyptian Tax Authority (ETA), in association with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), issued transfer-pricing guidelines in 2010. These guidelines advise taxpayers on the application of the arm’s-length principle in pricing their intragroup transactions and outline the documentation that taxpayers should maintain as evidence to demonstrate their compliance with the arm’s-length principle. On 22 May 2018, the Egyptian government issued Ministerial Decree No. 221 of 2018, which amended the Income Tax Law Executive Regulations to align Egypt’s rules more closely with the international consensus on transfer pricing reflected in the OECD transfer-pricing guidelines. On 23 October 2018, the ETA issued a revised version of the 2010 transfer-pricing guidelines on its website. The new guidelines consist of the following two parts: • Principles and Implementation • Advance Pricing Agreements The guidelines introduce a three-tiered transfer-pricing documentation approach and introduce the following significant new compliance obligations in Egypt: • Local file: A taxpayer engaged in transactions with related parties is expected to prepare local transfer-pricing documentation and submit it to the ETA within two months following the filing of the 2018 corporate tax return. • Country-by-Country Report (CbCR): An Egyptian parent company of a multinational group with consolidated group revenue of at least EGP3 billion (EUR148 million) must file a CbCR in Egypt. The submission deadline is 12 months from the end of the reporting fiscal year. • Master file: The master file must be prepared at the ultimate parent level of the group and must be made available to the ETA based on the parent entity’s tax return filling date in its home jurisdiction. The APA program is designed to enable taxpayers and the ETA to agree on the proper treatment of the transfer pricing of potential controlled transaction(s) in which the taxpayer will engage for a specific period (typically more than one year) under certain terms and conditions. The APA program is intended to provide a cooperative process to resolve potential transfer-pricing disputes in advance.

The law stipulates specific transfer-pricing penalties for noncompliance, thereby completing the transferpricing legislative framework. The penalty imposed by the Unified Tax Procedures Law is 1% of the total value of the related-party transactions that are not declared in the taxpayer’s corporate income tax return. In addition, the law introduced a filing threshold for master and local files. Under the law, a taxpayer must prepare and submit the master file and the local file if its aggregate related-party transactions exceed EGP8 million for the year. However, Law No. 211 of 2020, which was published on 3 December 2020, amended some provisions of Law No. 206, introducing stricter penalties for noncompliance relating to transfer pricing documentation. The following are the penalties: • Failure to declare the accurate value of related-party transactions (Table 508) for corporate income tax returns due to be filed on or after 20 October 2020: 1% of the total value of the taxpayer’s undeclared related-party transactions (local and cross-border transactions) during the fiscal year • Failure to submit a master file or local file on time: 3% of the total value of the taxpayer’s related-party transactions (local and cross-border transactions) during the fiscal year • Failure to submit a CbCR (if the taxpayer is the ultimate parent entity of a multinational group) or notification (if the taxpayer is the constituent entity) on time: 2% of the total value of the taxpayer’s related-party transactions (local and cross-border transactions) during the fiscal year The table below sets forth maximum withholding rates provided in Egypt’s double tax treaties for dividends, interest and royalties.

In essence, this would introduce an “allowable purpose” test for the financing. In addition, the acceptable interest margin for a foreign financing company (and any other “intermediate” in an intercompany “financial relationship”) is effectively limited to the current market return of government bonds with “highest” rating or solvency and corresponding maturity (which may be zero or even negative in Europe at the moment).

HKG,2019,Hong Kong,transfer pricing,"Transfer pricing. Under the specific transfer-pricing legislation (TP law), transactions between connected persons (including those between different parts of the same enterprise located in different jurisdictions) are required to be priced and conducted on an arm’slength basis. Certain specified domestic transactions that do not result in any actual tax difference or meet the non-business loan condition are specifically exempt from the TP law, provided that certain prescribed conditions are met. The transfer-pricing guidelines of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) provide guidance on how the TP law should be interpreted. TP documentation requirements. The TP law also adopts the three-tier documentation approach as recommended by the OECD for related-party transactions, which is comprised of the following: • Local File • Master File • Country-by-Country (CbC) Reporting A Hong Kong entity of a group is required to prepare and retain the entity’s Local File and a Master File of its group with respect to an accounting period unless either of the following circumstances exists: • Any two of the following conditions are satisfied: — The total amount of the entity’s revenue for the accounting period does not exceed HKD400 million. —  The total value of the entity’s assets at the end of the accounting period does not exceed HKD300 million. — The average number of the entity’s employees during the accounting period does not exceed 100. • All the following conditions are satisfied with respect to the following categories of transactions between connected persons (excluding specified domestic transactions) undertaken by the entity in an accounting period: —  The total amount of transfers of properties (excluding financial assets and intangibles) does not exceed HKD220 million. — The total amount of transactions with respect to financial assets does not exceed HKD110 million. — The total amount of transfers of intangibles does not exceed HKD110 million. — The total amount of other transactions does not exceed HKD44 million. If all of the conditions stated in the second bullet above are not satisfied, the entity is required to prepare a Local File with respect to the particular category(ies) of transactions that exceeded the threshold(s) specified above. In addition, the entity is not exempt from preparing the Master File. Unless exempted, effective from the accounting period beginning on or after 1 April 2018, the Master File and Local File must be prepared within nine months after the end of the relevant accounting period. Although the Master File and Local File are not required to be submitted together with the annual tax return, they must be produced for examination on request and retained for a period of not less than seven years after the end of the accounting period. Country-by-Country Reporting. The CbC Report filing threshold is set in accordance with the OECD recommendation; that is, consolidated turnover exceeding EUR750 million (HKD6.8 billion) in the preceding year. The primary obligation for CbC Report filing falls on the Ultimate Parent Entities (UPEs) of multinational groups that are resident in Hong Kong.

The safe-harbor provisions are now extended to the 2018-19 fiscal year with certain modifications in thresholds for eligible international transactions. For the 2016-17 fiscal year, the taxpayer can opt for safe harbors under the old rules or the amended rules, whichever are more beneficial. The transfer-pricing regulations require each person entering into an international transaction to maintain prescribed documents and information regarding a transaction. Each person entering into an international transaction must arrange for an accountant to prepare a report and furnish it to the Tax Officer by the due date for filing the corporate tax return, which is 30 November in such circumstances. A tax officer may make an adjustment with respect to an international transaction, if the officer determines that certain conditions exist, including any of the following: • The price is not at arm’s length. • The prescribed documents and information have not been maintained. • The information or data on the basis of which the price was determined is not reliable. • Information or documents requested by the Tax Officer have not been furnished. Stringent penalties (up to 2% of the transaction value) are imposed for non-compliance with the procedural requirements and for understatement of profits. Measures allowing Advance Pricing Agreements (APAs) are effective from July 2012. Under these measures, the tax administration may enter into an APA with any person undertaking an international transaction. APAs are binding on the taxpayer and the tax authorities (provided no change in law and facts) and are valid for a maximum period of five consecutive years. The APA scheme provides for a “rollback” mechanism, which is subject to prescribed conditions and procedures. Under the “rollback” mechanism, an APA covering a future period may also be applied to international transactions entered into by a taxpayer during the periods (not exceeding four years) preceding the first year for which the APA is applicable.

IRL,2021,"Ireland, Republic of",transfer pricing,"Transfer pricing. Ireland introduced transfer-pricing regulations with effect for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011. The rules apply to any arrangement between associated enterprises involving any goods, services, money and/or intangible assets, if such arrangement would be considered “trading.” However, non-trading transactions are also in scope for transfer pricing with respect to accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2020, subject to some domestic carve-outs. The local transfer-pricing rules were also extended to capital transactions if the capital expenditure is incurred on or after 1 January 2020. The regulations apply to both domestic and cross-border transactions. Irish legislation has further been updated such that Irish borrowing entities now need to consider the arm’s-length nature of the quantum of loans entered into in the context of the total debt held by the entity. If a taxpayer has received debt from a connected party and as a result is claiming interest deductions for tax purposes, the taxpayer needs to be able to demonstrate that the interest charges do not exceed those that it would have claimed had it been funded entirely by third-party debt (at “arm’s length”). It is important to determine the amount and price (interest rate) of debt that the company could borrow under arm’s-length conditions. There is a general increased focus on substance over form: that is, the significant people functions; development, enhancement, maintenance, protection and exploitation (DEMPE) substance and control of risk; and the financial capacity to assume the risks. There is the potential for the Irish Revenue to recharacterize and to focus on the accurate delineation of the transaction. The extension of transfer-pricing rules to small and mediumsized enterprises (SMEs) will be implemented by way of a Ministerial Commencement order. Such rules would extend transfer-pricing rules to SMEs if the aggregate consideration for the related-party cross-border transaction is more than EUR1 million or if the value of assets if more than EUR25 million. For purposes of determining an arm’s-length price, the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations issued in 2007 were adopted for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2020. Sufficient records must be maintained to support an arm’s-length price, and companies are required to prepare Master File and Local File documentation if the group consolidated turnover is in excess of EUR250 million and EUR50 million, respectively. There will be simplified transfer-pricing documentation requirements for SMEs if the group has fewer than 250 employees and either of the following: • Turnover of less than EUR50 million • Assets of less than EUR43 million The small and medium-sized thresholds are assessed on a group-wide consolidated basis. There is a requirement for transfer-pricing documentation to be prepared by a company’s corporation tax filing deadline, and a fixed-rate penalty of EUR25,000 applies if such documentation is not provided to the Irish Revenue on request (plus EUR100 per day that such requested documents remain outstanding). A further penalty of EUR4,000 is imposed for noncompliance if information to support the transfer-pricing policy requested by the Irish Revenue is not provided within 30 days. However, if the taxpayer prepares transfer-pricing documentation that demonstrates a reasonable effort to comply with the transfer-pricing legislation, there is protection from tax-geared penalties in the careless behavior category.",3621,FALSE,yes,yes,High income,1,0

Under these rules, intragroup transactions must be carried out at arm’s length. In principle, Italian transfer-pricing rules do not apply to domestic transactions. However, case law provides that grossly inadequate prices in these transactions can be adjusted on abuseof-law grounds (for example, a transaction between a taxpaying company and another with net operating losses that are on the verge of expiring).

The last two items mentioned above also apply to onshore transactions that are connected with international business operations, which are defined as import or export transactions with respect to goods, works and services. Other cross-border transactions are subject to transfer-pricing rules if the transaction price is lower or higher than the market price by more than 10%. In applying the transfer-pricing rules, the tax authorities monitor certain types of transactions. The list of such transactions is established by a special resolution. The government has also issued a list of companies registered for tax purposes in Kazakhstan that are subject to transfer-pricing monitoring. If the tax authorities are not able to determine the market price, they may use the cost-plus or resaleminus method.

LVA,2018,Latvia,transfer pricing,"Transfer pricing. Latvian law requires the arm’s-length principle to be followed in all related-party transactions. The Latvian tax authorities may reassess transactions between related parties and recalculate the tax base if the prices applied in related-party transactions are not arm’s length. Transfer-pricing methods, such as the comparable uncontrolled price, resale price, cost-plus, profitsplit and transactional net margin methods, may be used to assess whether the prices applied in controlled transactions are consistent with the arm’s-length principle. Until 2018, Latvian taxpayers with annual net turnover exceeding EUR1,430,000 were required to prepare transfer-pricing documentation containing industry, company, functional and economic analysis. The documentation requirements applied to all related-party transactions with an annual value over EUR14,300. According to the draft law that will be adopted during 2018, for transactions carried out on or after 1 January 2018, the following transfer-pricing documentation must be prepared and submitted to the tax authorities within 12 months after the end of the respective financial year: • The Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Master File must be prepared and submitted if the annual amount of relatedparty cross-border transactions exceeds EUR5 million and the taxpayer’s net turnover exceeds EUR50 million or if the annual amount of related-party cross-border transactions exceeds EUR15 million. • The BEPS Local File must be prepared and submitted if the amount of related-party cross-border transactions exceeds EUR5 million. According to the draft law that will be adopted during 2018, for transactions carried out on or after 1 January 2018, the following transfer-pricing documentation must be prepared within 12 months after the end of the respective financial year and submitted to the tax authorities within 1 month after request: • The BEPS Master File must be prepared and filed after request if the annual amount of related-party cross-border transactions does not exceed EUR15 million and the taxpayer’s net turnover does not exceed EUR50 million, but the annual amount of related-party cross-border transactions exceeds EUR5 million. • The BEPS Local File must be prepared and filed after request if the amount of related-party cross-border transactions exceeds EUR250,000, but does not exceed EUR5 million. The Country-by-Country Report notification applies to all resident entities that are part of a qualifying group (the threshold is EUR750 million). Transfer-pricing disclosures must be submitted together with the 12th monthly corporate income tax return, which is due four to seven months after the end of the financial year. The generally accepted practice for transfer-pricing issues is based on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations.

MYS,2020,Malaysia,transfer pricing,"Transfer pricing. The tax authorities have issued transfer-pricing legislation, rules and guidelines requiring taxpayers to determine and apply an arm’s-length price in their intercompany transactions. The transfer-pricing rules also require the preparation of contemporaneous transfer-pricing documentation to substantiate the arm’s-length contention. The guidelines provide a detailed list of information, documentation and records with respect to related-party transactions that need to be compiled to meet the contemporaneous documentation requirement. The guidelines are based on the arm’s-length principle set forth in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) transfer-pricing guidelines and provide several methods for determining an arm’s-length price. In addition, companies carrying out cross-border transactions with associated persons may apply for an advance pricing arrangement (APA) from the tax authorities subject to conditions. Specific measures previously existed in the tax law to address thin-capitalization adjustments. However, the implementation of the thin-capitalization section was deferred until 31 December 2017, and the thin-capitalization section was ultimately repealed, effective from 1 January 2018. The thin-capitalization rules were eventually replaced by the earnings stripping rules (ESR), which are based on the principles in Action 4 of the OECD’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Plan. The ESR took effect on 1 July 2019 and restricts the deduction of interest on financial assistance granted in controlled transactions, if the total amount of the interest expense for all such financial assistance exceeds MYR500,000 in the basis year for a year of assessment. The ESR applies only to cross-border financial assistance from associated parties and cross-border financial assistance from third parties if such assistance is guaranteed by related parties in or outside Malaysia.

MLT,2021,Malta,transfer pricing,"Transfer pricing. Although Maltese tax law does not provide any detailed transfer-pricing requirements or guidelines, certain provisions incorporate a concept analogous to the arm’s-length principle. In the absence of detailed guidelines, the Maltese tax authorities tend to the refer to the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines. Consequently, it is advisable that the terms of any cross-border transaction entered into between two associated enterprises adhere to the arm’s-length principle as contemplated in the guidelines. No transfer-pricing documentation requirements apply other than Country-by-Country Reporting. Under Maltese domestic tax law, dividends, interest, discounts, pre­miums and royalties paid to nonresidents are not subject to with­holding tax. Interest and royalties paid to nonresidents are exempt from income tax in Malta if they are not effectively connected with a permanent establishment in Malta through which the nonresidents engage in a trade or business. Under Malta’s tax treaties, the maximum tax rates applicable to dividends paid by Maltese companies to persons resident in the other treaty jurisdictions do not exceed the tax rate payable by the recipient companies in Malta.

NLD,2004,NETHERLANDS,transfer pricing,"Transfer Pricing. The Dutch tax law includes the arm’s length principle contained in the OECD model tax convention and in the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines. Associated enterprises should prepare documentation that establishes how transfer prices were determined and provides a basis for determining whether the terms of the intercompany transactions would have been adopted if the parties were unrelated.

NLD,2016,Netherlands,transfer pricing,"Transfer pricing. The Dutch tax law includes the arm’s-length principle (codified in the Corporate Income Tax Act) and contains specific transfer-pricing documentation requirements. Transactions between associated enterprises (controlled transactions) must be documented. Such documentation should include a description of the terms of the controlled transactions, the entities (and permanent establishments) involved and a thorough analysis of the socalled five comparability factors (both from the perspective of the controlled transactions and companies and uncontrolled transactions and companies), of which the functional analysis is the most important. The documentation must establish how transfer prices were determin ed and provide a basis for determining whether the terms of the intercompany transactions would have been adopted if the parties were unrelated. If such information is not available on request in the case of an audit or litigation, the burden of proof with respect to the arm’s-length nature of the transfer prices shifts to the taxpayer. As a result, the taxpayer is exposed to possible noncompliance penalty charges. Taxpayers can use the Dutch transferpricing decrees for guidance. These decrees provide the Dutch interpretation of the OECD transfer-pricing guidelines. Effective from 1 January 2016, additional transfer-pricing requirements are included in the Dutch tax law. In line with the OECD’s report on Action Point 13 of the BEPS plan, new standards for transfer-pricing documentation are introduced. These new standards consist of a three-tiered structure for transferpricing documentation that includes a master file, a local file and a template for a Country-by-Country (CbC) Report. The CbC Report applies to Dutch tax resident entities that are members of a multinational enterprise (MNE) group with consolidated group turnover exceeding EUR750 million in the tax year preceding the tax year to which the CbC Report applies. In addition, Dutch tax resident entities of a MNE group also have to prepare a master file and a local file if the group has consolidated group turnover exceeding EUR50 million in the tax year preceding the tax year for which the tax return applies. At the time of writing, the Dutch government had not yet issued further guidance on the specific implementation of the master, local file and CbC reporting requirements.

The Dutch tax law includes the arm’s-length prin­ ciple (codified in the Corporate Income Tax Act) and contains specific transfer-pricing documentation requirements. Transactions between associated enterprises (controlled transactions) must be documented. Such documentation should include a description of the terms of the controlled transactions, the entities (and permanent establishments) involved and a thorough analysis of the socalled five comparability factors (both from the perspective of the controlled transactions and companies and uncontrolled transactions and companies), of which the functional analysis is the most important. The documentation must establish how transfer prices were determin­ed and provide a basis for determining whether the terms of the intercompany transactions would have been adopted if the parties were unrelated. If such information is not available on request in the case of an audit or litigation, the burden of proof with respect to the arm’s-length nature of the transfer prices shifts to the taxpayer. Also, the taxpayer is exposed to possible non­ compliance penalty charges. Taxpayers can use the Dutch transferpricing decrees for guidance. These decrees provide the Dutch interpretation of the OECD transfer-pricing guidelines. Additional transfer-pricing requirements in the Dutch tax law took effect on 1 January 2016. In line with the OECD’s report on Action 13 of the BEPS plan, new standards for transfer-pricing documentation were introduced. These new standards consist of a three-tiered structure for transfer-pricing documentation that includes a master file, a local file and a template for a Countryby-Country (CbC) Report. The CbC Report applies to Dutch tax resident entities that are members of a multinational enterprise (MNE) group with consolidated group turnover exceeding EUR750 million in the tax year preceding the tax year to which the CbC Report applies. In addition, Dutch tax resident entities of a MNE group also have to prepare a master file and a local file if the group has consolidated group turnover exceeding EUR50 million in the tax year preceding the tax year for which the tax return applies. A Dutch tax resident that is a member of a MNE group must notify the Dutch tax authorities as to which entity within the MNE group will file the CbC Report by the last day of the reporting year (for example, if the reporting year is the calendar year, a notification must be filed by 31 December 2019). This is a recurring requirement. The Dutch government has also issued further guidance on the master, local file and CbC reporting requirements through Ministerial Regulations.

Taxpayers exceeding the annual revenue threshold are only required to prepare and submit the Master File if aggregate annual related-party transactions equal or exceed 400 Tax Units (approximately USD500,000 for the 2019 fiscal year 2019) during the relevant year. The Master File provides highlevel information on the group’s business operations, its transfer-pricing policies and its global allocation of income and economic activity. Specifically, the information required in the Master File provides a “blueprint” of the group and contains relevant information that is grouped in the following five categories: — The group’s organizational structure — A description of its business or businesses — The group’s intangibles — The group’s intercompany financial activities — The group’s financial and tax positions In general, the Master File is intended to assist the tax authorities in evaluating the presence of significant transfer-pricing risks and provide an overview of the group to place its transferpricing practices in their global, economic, legal, financial and tax contexts. • Country-by-Country Report (CbCR): this report is required for taxpayers forming part of multinational groups, in accordance with Action 13 of the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Action Plan of the OECD. The CbCR must include aggregate worldwide tax jurisdiction information relating to the global allocation of the revenue, profits (or losses), income taxes paid (and accrued) and certain indicators of the location of economic activity among tax jurisdictions in which the multinational group operates. The CbCR also must contain a listing of all of the constituent entities of the group. This listing must include the tax jurisdictions of incorporation, as well as the nature of the main business activities carried out by the constituent entities. Under BEPS Action 13, the CbCR should be filed in the jurisdiction of tax residence of the ultimate parent entity of a multinational enterprise group and is shared between jurisdictions through the automatic exchange of information, by a government mechanism under the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters, bilateral tax treaties or tax information exchange agreements.

PER,2020,Peru,transfer pricing,"Transfer pricing. Peru’s transfer-pricing rules apply to cross-border and domestic transactions between related parties and to all transactions with residents in tax-haven jurisdictions. Effective from 2019, the transfer-pricing rules also apply to transactions with residents in non-cooperating jurisdictions, as well as transactions with residents whose revenue or income is subject to a preferential tax regime. The transfer-pricing rules are consistent with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guidelines. Intercompany charges must be determined at arm’s length. Regardless of the relationship be­­tween the parties involved, the fair market value (FMV) must be used in various types of transactions, such as the following: • Sales • Contributions of property • Transfers of property • Provision of services For the sale of merchandise (inventory), the FMV is the price typ­ ically charged to third parties in profit-making transactions. For frequent transactions involving fixed assets, the FMV is the value used in such frequent transactions by other taxpayers or parties. For sporadic transactions involving fixed assets, the FMV is the appraisal value. In the event that the transactions are performed without using the FMV, the tax authorities will make the appropriate adjustments for the parties to the transaction. The FMV of transactions between related parties is the value used by the taxpayer in identical or similar transactions with unrelated parties. The tax authorities may apply the most appropriate of the following transfer pricing methods to reflect the economic r ­ eality of the transactions: • Comparable uncontrolled price method • Cost-plus method • Resale price method • Profit-based method Transfer-pricing aspects of cross-border commodity transac­ tions. Effective from 1 January 2019, specific rules are introduced for applying the comparable uncontrolled price method to the exportation and importation of commodities and other products, with prices set by reference to commodity prices. The tax regulations provide lists of export and import products whose prices are set by reference to quoted prices. The following is the list of export products: • Copper • Gold • Silver • Zinc • Fishmeal The following is the list of import products: • Corn • Soy • Wheat Advance pricing agreements. The transfer-pricing rules provide for advance pricing agreements between taxpayers and the Peruvian tax authorities. Intragroup services. To deduct amounts paid for services provided between related parties, taxpayers must comply with the benefit test and provide the documentation and information requested by the tax authorities. The benefit test is met if the services rendered provide economic or commercial value to the recipient of the service or improves or maintains the commercial position of the recipient. This can be established if independent parties would be satisfied as to the need for the service, whether they perform the services themselves or through a third party. In this regard, the information and documentation provided must evidence the actual performance of the service, the nature of the service, the actual necessity for the service, and the cost and expenses incurred by the service provider. Regarding low value-adding services, the service provider must apply a profit markup of no more than 5% to the relevant costs incurred in performing the services. Low value-adding services for purposes of this approach are services performed by one member or more than one member of a multinational enterprise group on behalf of one or more other group members. The services must satisfy all of the following conditions: • They must be of a supportive nature. • They must not be part of the core business of the multinational enterprise group. • They must not require the use of unique and valuable intangibles and must not lead to the creation of unique and valuable intangibles. • They must not involve the assumption or control of substantial risk by the service provider and must not give rise to the creation of significant risk for the service provider. Under tax regulations, the following do not qualify as low valueadding services, unless they meet the above characteristics: • Research and development services • Manufacturing and production services • Purchase activities related to raw materials or other materials that are used in the manufacturing or production process • Sales, distribution and marketing activities • Financial transactions • Extraction, exploration or transformation of natural resources • Insurance and reinsurance • Senior management services Transfer pricing documentation and Country-by-Country report­ ing.

POL,2004,POLAND,transfer pricing,"Transfer Pricing. The Polish tax law includes specific rules on transfer pricing. The fundamental rules, which are based on the OECD guidelines, are contained in the Corporate Profits Tax Law and the Personal Income Tax Law. Under the Corporate Profits Tax Law, the following are related parties: • A domestic entity (a legal or natural person having its registered office [place of management] or residence in Poland) and a foreign entity (a legal or natural person having its registered office or residence abroad), if any of the following circumstances exist: — The domestic entity participates, directly or indirectly, in the management, control or capital of the foreign entity; — The foreign entity participates, directly or indirectly, in the management, control or capital of the domestic entity; or — The same legal or natural persons participate, directly or indirectly, in the management, control or capital of both the domestic entity and the foreign entity. • Two domestic entities, if the following circumstances exist: — The domestic entity participates, directly or indirectly, in the management, control or capital of the other domestic entity; — The same legal or natural persons participate, directly or indirectly, in the management, control or capital of both the domestic entity and the foreign entity; or — Family, capital, property or employment relations exist between the entities or the management, supervision or control personnel of the entities, or the same persons carry out management, supervision or control functions in both of the entities. The tax law provides for the following transfer-pricing methods: • The comparable uncontrolled price method; • The resale-minus method; and • The cost-plus method. If the above methods are inapplicable, the transaction profit method may be used. Under the law, on the request of the tax authorities, taxpayers conducting transactions with related parties exceeding certain limits (relatively low) are required to prepare specific tax documentation regarding these transactions and present it to the tax authorities or tax inspection authorities within seven days of the date of the request. The documentation must contain the following: • A description of the functions of the parties to the transaction (including assets used and risks taken); • All expected costs of the transaction and the method and terms of payment; • The method for calculating profits and a description of the transaction price; • A description of the business strategy and any other related activity if this strategy affects the transaction value; • An indication of any other factors that were taken into account when determining the transaction value; and • A description of the benefits that the entity is required to prepare the documentation expects to obtain from transactions of an intangible nature, such as the rendering of advisory services or financial services, or the granting of licenses. The documentation requirements apply if the total value of the transactions concluded between related parties exceeds the following amounts in a tax year: • € 100,000 if the value of the transactions is less than 20% of the company’s share capital; • € 30,000 for transactions involving sales, the rendering of services or the providing of intangible assets; and • € 50,000 in all other circumstances. The documentation requirements also apply to entities that enter into transactions involving payments to tax havens if the total value of the transactions exceeds € 20,000 during the tax year. If the tax authorities assess additional income to a taxpayer and if a taxpayer does not provide the transfer-pricing documentation required by the law, the additional income is taxed at a penalty tax rate of 50%. Taxpayers must report foreign related-party transactions if the total amount of the transactions exceeds € 300,000 in a tax year. If the foreign entity has a representative office or a permanent establishment in Poland, the reporting obligation applies to single transactions exceeding € 5,000. The required information must be submitted to the tax office by the end of the third month following the end of the tax year.

The fundamental rules, which are based on the OECD guidelines, are contained in the Corporate Profits Tax Law and the Personal Income Tax Law. Under the Corporate Profits Tax Law, the following are related parties: • A domestic entity (a legal or natural person having its registered office [place of management] or residence in Poland) and a foreign entity (a legal or natural person having its registered office or residence abroad), if any of the following circumstances exist: — The domestic entity participates, directly or indirectly, in the management, control or capital of the foreign entity; — The foreign entity participates, directly or indirectly, in the management, control or capital of the domestic entity; or — The same legal or natural persons participate, directly or indirectly, in the management, control or capital of both the domestic entity and the foreign entity. • Two domestic entities, if the following circumstances exist: — The domestic entity participates, directly or indirectly, in the management, control or capital of the other domestic entity; — The same legal or natural persons participate, directly or indirectly, in the management, control or capital of both the domestic entity and the foreign entity; or — Family, capital, property or employment relations exist between the entities or the management, supervision or control personnel of the entities, or the same persons carry out management, supervision or control functions in both of the entities. The tax law provides for the following transfer-pricing methods: • The comparable uncontrolled price method; • The resale-minus method; and • The cost-plus method. If the above methods are inapplicable, the transaction profit method may be used. Under the law, on the request of the tax authorities, taxpayers conducting transactions with related parties exceeding certain limits (relatively low) are required to prepare specific tax documentation regarding these transactions and present it to the tax authorities or tax inspection authorities within seven days of the date of the request. The documentation must contain the following: • A description of the functions of the parties to the transaction (including assets used and risks taken); • All expected costs of the transaction and the method and terms of payment; • The method for calculating profits and a description of the transaction price; • A description of the business strategy and any other related activity if this strategy affects the transaction value; • An indication of any other factors that were taken into account when determining the transaction value; and • A description of the benefits that the entity is required to prepare the documentation expects to obtain from transactions of an intangible nature, such as the rendering of advisory services or financial services, or the granting of licenses. The documentation requirements also apply to entities that enter into transactions involving payments to tax havens if the total value of the transactions exceeds €20,000 during the tax year. If the tax authorities assess additional income to a taxpayer and if a taxpayer does not provide the transfer-pricing documentation required by the law, the additional income is taxed at a penalty tax rate of 50%. Taxpayers must report foreign related-party transactions if the total amount of the transactions exceeds €300,000 in a tax year. If the foreign entity has a representative office or a permanent establishment in Poland, the reporting obligation applies to single transactions exceeding €5,000. The required information must be submitted to the tax office by the end of the third month following the end of the tax year. Under the existing law, it is not possible to reach transfer-pricing agreements in advance with the tax authorities. However, under pending changes to the tax code, advance pricing agreements (APAs) will be allowed. The draft regulations provide that the effective date for the allowance of APAs will be 1 January 2007.

POL,2011,Poland,transfer pricing,"Transfer pricing. The Polish tax law includes specific rules on transfer pricing. The fundamental rules, which are based on the OECD guidelines, are contained in the Corporate Income Tax Law and the Personal Income Tax Law. Under the Corporate Income Tax Law, the following are related parties: • A domestic entity (a legal or natural person having its registered office [place of management] or residence in Poland) and a foreign entity (a legal or natural person having its registered office or residence abroad), if any of the following circumstances exist: — The domestic entity participates, directly or indirectly, in the management, control or capital of the foreign entity. — The foreign entity participates, directly or indirectly, in the management, control or capital of the domestic entity. — The same legal or natural persons participate, directly or indirectly, in the management, control or capital of both the domestic entity and the foreign entity. • Two domestic entities, if the following circumstances exist: — The domestic entity participates, directly or indirectly, in the management, control or capital of the other domestic entity. — The same legal or natural persons participate, directly or indirectly, in the management, control or capital of the domestic entities. — Family, capital, property or employment relations exist between the entities or the management, supervision or control personnel of the entities, or the same persons carry out management, supervision or control functions in the entities. Polish tax law enumerates transfer-pricing methods that must be followed by the tax authorities in testing the prices applied in intercompany transactions (taxpayers do not have to apply these methods). The tax law provides for the following traditional transfer-pricing methods: • The comparable uncontrolled price method (preferable one) • The resale-price method • The cost-plus method If the above methods are inapplicable, the transactional methods (profit-split method and transactional net margin method) can be considered. Under the tax law, on the request of the tax authorities, taxpayers conducting transactions with related parties exceeding certain statutory thresholds (of a relatively low value) must prepare specific tax documentation regarding these transactions and present it to the tax authorities or tax inspection authorities within seven days after the date of the request. The documentation must be in Polish and must contain the following: • A description of the functions of the parties to the transaction (including assets engaged and risks assumed) • All expected costs of the transaction and the method and terms of payment • The method for calculating profits and a description of the transaction price • A description of the business strategy and any other related activity if this strategy affects the transaction value • An indication of any other factors that were taken into account in determining the transaction value • A description of the benefits that the entity required to prepare the documentation expects to obtain from the purchase of intangible assets or services, such as advisory or financial services, granting of licenses or purchase of intellectual property The documentation requirements also apply to entities that enter into transactions involving payments to tax havens if the total value of the transactions exceeds €20,000 during the tax year. If the tax authorities assess additional income to a taxpayer and if a taxpayer does not provide the transfer-pricing documentation required by the law, additional income that is assessed in connection with intercompany transactions that are not covered with the documentation is taxed at a penalty tax rate of 50%. Effective from 1 January 2007, the transfer-pricing documentation requirements applicable to Polish entities also apply to PEs of foreign residents located in Poland. In addition, if income earned by the PE of a foreign resident is assessed in Poland and if no transfer-pricing documentation is submitted by the statutory deadline, a corporate income tax rate of 50% can be applied to any excess over the fair market amount. Taxpayers must report foreign related-party transactions if the total amount of the transactions exceeds €300,000 in a tax year. If the foreign entity has a representative office or a permanent establishment in Poland, the reporting obligation applies to single transactions exceeding €5,000. The required information must be submitted to the tax office by the end of the third month following the end of the tax year. The Advanced Pricing Agreement (APA) regulations entered into force on 1 January 2006. An APA concluded for a particular transaction is binding on the tax authorities with respect to the method selected by the taxpayer. APAs may apply to transactions that have not yet been executed or transactions that are in progress when the taxpayer submits an application for an APA. In June 2006, Poland ratified the EU convention on the elimination of double taxation in connection with the adjustment of profits of associated enterprises (90/436/EEC). The standard withholding tax rates are 19% for dividends and 20% for interest and royalties. The rate may be reduced under a double tax treaty on presentation of a certificate of tax residence or, in some cases, under domestic regulations. The following table shows the withholding tax rates under Polish double tax treaties.

If the foreign entity has a representative office or a permanent establishment in Poland, the reporting obligation applies to single transactions exceeding €5,000. The required information must be submitted to the tax office by the end of the third month following the end of the tax year. The Advanced Pricing Agreement (APA) regulations entered into force on 1 January 2006. An APA concluded for a particular transaction is binding on the tax authorities with respect to the method selected by the taxpayer.

POL,2014,Poland,transfer pricing,"Transfer pricing. The Polish tax law includes specific rules on transfer pricing. The fundamental rules, which are based on the OECD guidelines, are contained in the Corporate Income Tax Law and the Personal Income Tax Law. Under the Corporate Income Tax Law, the following are related parties: • A domestic entity (a legal or natural person having its registered office [place of management] or residence in Poland) and a foreign entity (a legal or natural person having its registered office [place of management] or residence abroad), if any of the following circumstances exist: — The domestic entity participates, directly or indirectly, in the management, control or capital of the foreign entity. — The foreign entity participates, directly or indirectly, in the management, control or capital of the domestic entity. — The same legal or natural persons participate, directly or indirectly, in the management, control or capital of both the domestic entity and the foreign entity. • Two domestic entities, if the following circumstances exist: — The domestic entity participates, directly or indirectly, in the management, control or capital of the other domestic entity. — The same legal or natural persons participate, directly or indirectly, in the management, control or capital of the domestic entities. — Family, capital, property or employment relations exist between the entities or the management, supervision or control personnel of the entities, or the same persons carry out management, supervision or control functions in the entities. Polish tax law enumerates transfer-pricing methods that must be followed by the tax authorities in testing the prices applied in intercompany transactions (taxpayers do not have to apply these methods). The tax law provides for the following traditional transfer-pricing methods: • The comparable uncontrolled price method (preferable one) • The resale-price method • The cost-plus method If the above methods are inapplicable, the transactional methods (profit-split method and transactional net margin method) can be considered. Under the tax law, on the request of the tax authorities, taxpayers conducting transactions with related parties exceeding certain statutory thresholds (of a relatively low value) must prepare specific tax documentation regarding these transactions and present it to the tax authorities or tax inspection authorities within seven days after the date of the request. The documentation must be in Polish and must contain the following: • A description of the functions of the parties to the transaction (including assets engaged and risks assumed) • All expected costs of the transaction and the method and terms of payment • The method for calculating profits and a description of the transaction price • A description of the business strategy and any other related activity if this strategy affects the transaction value • An indication of any other factors that were taken into account in determining the transaction value • A description of the benefits that the entity required to prepare the documentation expects to obtain from the purchase of intangible assets or services, such as advisory or financial services, granting of licenses or purchase of intellectual property The documentation requirements also apply to entities that enter into transactions involving payments to tax havens if the total value of the transactions exceeds EUR20,000 during the tax year. If the tax authorities assess additional income to a taxpayer and if a taxpayer does not provide the transfer-pricing documentation required by the law, additional income that is assessed in connection with intercompany transactions that are not covered with the documentation is taxed at a penalty tax rate of 50%. Effective from 1 January 2007, the transfer-pricing documentation requirements applicable to Polish entities also apply to PEs of foreign residents located in Poland. In addition, if income earned by the PE of a foreign resident is assessed in Poland and if no transfer-pricing documentation is submitted by the statutory deadline, a corporate income tax rate of 50% can be applied to any excess over the fair market amount. Taxpayers must report foreign related-party transactions if the total amount of the transactions exceeds EUR300,000 in a tax year.

Further changes are expected in the application of the transferpricing rules to partnerships and joint ventures. However, the final shape of the amendments is not yet known.

Polish transfer-pricing regulations indicate that the tax authorities must examine the terms agreed to or imposed with respect to business restructuring projects between related parties for compatibility with the terms that independent companies would have negotiated. They also cover the examination of the accuracy of the grounds for the right of related parties to receive a fee, and the amount of such fee, in business restructuring projects. Under the tax law, on the request of the tax authorities, taxpayers conducting transactions with related parties exceeding certain statutory thresholds (of a relatively low value) must prepare specific tax documentation regarding these transactions and present it to the tax authorities or tax inspection authorities within seven days after the date of the request. In addition, effective from 2015, tax documentation must be prepared with respect to an agreement to set up an entity without legal form, a joint venture agreement or a similar agreement. The documentation must be in Polish and must contain the following: • A description of the functions of the parties to the transaction (including assets engaged and risks assumed) • All expected costs of the transaction and the method and terms of payment • The method for calculating profits and a description of the transaction price • A description of the business strategy and any other related activity if this strategy affects the transaction value • An indication of any other factors that were taken into account in determining the transaction value (a description of rules for the share of profits or losses between partners must be provided with respect to an agreement to set up an entity without legal form, joint venture agreement or a similar agreement) • A description of the benefits that the entity required to prepare the documentation expects to obtain from the purchase of intangible assets or services, such as advisory or financial services, granting of licenses or purchase of intellectual property Transfer-pricing regulations also define low value-added services and indicate the information to be verified by authorities while auditing these types of transactions. A transfer-pricing decree provides a list of shareholder costs that are not deductible for tax purposes in Poland. The documentation requirements also apply to entities that enter into transactions involving payments to tax havens if the total value of the transactions exceeds EUR20,000 during the tax year. If the tax authorities assess additional income to a taxpayer and if a taxpayer does not provide the transfer-pricing documentation required by the law, additional income that is assessed in connection with intercompany transactions that are not covered with the documentation is taxed at a penalty tax rate of 50%. The transfer-pricing documentation requirements applicable to Polish entities also apply to permanent establishments of foreign residents located in Poland and to permanent establishments of Polish entities. In addition, if income earned by the permanent establishment of a foreign resident is assessed in Poland and if no transfer-pricing documentation is submitted by the statutory deadline, a corporate income tax rate of 50% can be applied to any excess over the fair market amount. Taxpayers must report foreign related-party transactions if the total amount of the transactions exceeds EUR300,000 in a tax year. If the foreign entity has a representative office or a permanent establishment in Poland, the reporting obligation applies to single transactions exceeding EUR5,000.

Under the Corporate Income Tax Law, the following are related parties: • A domestic entity (a legal person, natural person or organizational unit without legal form having its registered office [place of management] or residence in Poland) and a foreign entity (a legal or natural person having its registered office [place of management] or residence abroad), if any of the following circumstances exist: — The domestic entity participates, directly or indirectly, in the management, control or capital of the foreign entity. — The foreign entity participates, directly or indirectly, in the management, control or capital of the domestic entity. — The same legal person, natural person or organizational unit without legal form participates, directly or indirectly, in the management, control or capital of both the domestic entity and the foreign entity. • Two domestic entities, if the following circumstances exist: — The domestic entity participates, directly or indirectly, in the management, control or capital of the other domestic entity. — The same legal person, natural person or organizational unit without legal form participates, directly or indirectly, in the management, control or capital of the domestic entities. — Family, capital, property or employment relations exist between the entities or the management, supervision or control personnel of the entities, or the same persons carry out management, supervision or control functions in the entities. Polish tax law enumerates transfer-pricing methods that must be followed by the tax authorities in testing the prices applied in intercompany transactions (taxpayers do not have to apply these methods). The tax law provides for the following traditional transfer-pricing methods: • The comparable uncontrolled price method (preferable one) • The resale-price method • The cost-plus method If the above methods are inapplicable, the transactional methods (profit-split method and transactional net margin method) can be considered. Polish transfer-pricing regulations indicate that the tax authorities must examine the terms agreed to or imposed with respect to business restructuring projects between related parties for compatibility with the terms that independent companies would have negotiated. They also cover the examination of the accuracy of the grounds for the right of related parties to receive a fee, and the amount of such fee, in business restructuring projects. Under the tax law, on the request of the tax authorities, taxpayers conducting transactions with related parties exceeding certain statutory thresholds (of a relatively low value) must prepare specific tax documentation regarding these transactions and present it to the tax authorities or tax inspection authorities within seven days after the date of the request. In addition, effective from 2015, tax documentation must be prepared with respect to an agreement to set up an entity without legal form, a joint venture agreement or a similar agreement. The documentation must be in Polish and must contain the following: • A description of the functions of the parties to the transaction (including assets engaged and risks assumed) • All expected costs of the transaction and the method and terms of payment • The method for calculating profits and a description of the transaction price • A description of the business strategy and any other related activity if this strategy affects the transaction value • An indication of any other factors that were taken into account in determining the transaction value (a description of rules for the share of profits or losses between partners must be provided with respect to an agreement to set up an entity without legal form, joint venture agreement or a similar agreement) • A description of the benefits that the entity required to prepare the documentation expects to obtain from the purchase of intangible assets or services, such as advisory or financial services, granting of licenses or purchase of intellectual property Transfer-pricing regulations also define low value-added services and indicate the information to be verified by authorities while auditing these types of transactions. A transfer-pricing decree provides a list of shareholder costs that are not deductible for tax purposes in Poland. The documentation requirements also apply to entities that enter into transactions involving payments to tax havens if the total value of the transactions exceeds EUR20,000 during the tax year. If the tax authorities assess additional income to a taxpayer and if a taxpayer does not provide the transfer-pricing documentation required by the law, additional income that is assessed in connection with intercompany transactions that are not covered with the documentation is taxed at a penalty tax rate of 50%. The transfer-pricing documentation requirements applicable to Polish entities also apply to permanent establishments of foreign residents located in Poland and to permanent establishments of Polish entities. In addition, if income earned by the permanent establishment of a foreign resident is assessed in Poland and if no transfer-pricing documentation is submitted by the statutory deadline, a corporate income tax rate of 50% can be applied to any excess over the fair market amount. Taxpayers must report foreign related-party transactions if the total amount of the transactions exceeds EUR300,000 in a tax year. If the foreign entity has a representative office or a permanent establishment in Poland, the reporting obligation applies to single transactions exceeding EUR5,000. The required information must be submitted to the tax office by the end of the third month following the end of the tax year. The Advanced Pricing Agreement (APA) regulations entered into force on 1 January 2006. An APA concluded for a particular transaction is binding on the tax authorities with respect to the method selected by the taxpayer. APAs may apply to transactions that have not yet been executed or transactions that are in progress when the taxpayer submits an application for an APA. In June 2006, Poland ratified the EU convention on the elimination of double taxation in connection with the adjustment of profits of associated enterprises (90/436/EEC). Effective from 2015, it is possible to eliminate double taxation in domestic transactions. Effective from 2016, domestic entities must file a Country-byCountry Report (according to the template provided by the Polish Ministry of Finance) within 12 months from the last day of their fiscal year if they meet all of the following conditions: • They are parent companies and are not subsidiaries. • They are consolidating their financial statements. • They have a foreign permanent establishment or foreign subsidiary. • Their previous fiscal year consolidated revenues in Poland and abroad exceeded EUR750 million. The above measure applies to fiscal years beginning on or after 31 December 2015. Effective from 2017, fundamental changes will be introduced regarding the obligations and scope with respect to transfer-pricing documentation (new thresholds for transactions to be documented, extended scope of data to be presented in documentation and obligatory benchmarks reflecting the local market for certain type of entities). In addition, an obligation to supplement the annual corporate income tax return with a simplified report on transactions concluded with related parties for taxpayers with revenues or expenses exceeding EUR10 million will be introduced. Taxpayers will be also required to submit a signed declaration confirming that transfer-pricing documentation is in place (the declaration must be filed together with annual corporate income tax return). The capital relationship threshold will be increased from 5% to 25%, effective from 2017. The standard withholding tax rates are 19% for dividends and 20% for interest and royalties. The rate may be reduced under a double tax treaty on presentation of a certificate of tax residence or, in some cases, under domestic regulations. The following table shows the withholding tax rates under Polish double tax treaties.

POL,2017,Poland,transfer pricing,"Transfer pricing. The Polish tax law includes specific rules on transfer pricing. Effective from 2017, fundamental changes are introduced regarding the obligations and scope with respect to transfer-pricing documentation. The main rules, which are based on the OECD guidelines, are contained in the Corporate Income Tax Law and the Personal Income Tax Law. Under the Corporate Income Tax Law, the following are related parties: • A domestic entity (a legal person, natural person or organizational unit without legal form having its registered office [place of management] or residence in Poland) and a foreign entity (a legal or natural person having its registered office [place of management] or residence abroad), if any of the following circumstances exist: — The domestic entity participates, directly or indirectly, in the management, control or capital of the foreign entity. — The foreign entity participates, directly or indirectly, in the management, control or capital of the domestic entity. — The same legal person, natural person or organizational unit without legal form participates, directly or indirectly, in the management, control or capital of both the domestic entity and the foreign entity. • Two domestic entities, if the following circumstances exist: — The domestic entity participates, directly or indirectly, in the management, control or capital of the other domestic entity. — The same legal person, natural person or organizational unit without legal form participates, directly or indirectly, in the management, control or capital of the domestic entities. — Family, capital, property or employment relations exist between the entities or the management, supervision or control personnel of the entities, or the same persons carry out management, supervision or control functions in the entities. Effective from 2017, the capital relationship threshold for related parties is 25% (previously 5%).

They also cover the examination of the accuracy of the grounds for the right of related parties to receive a fee, and the amount of such fee, in business restructuring projects. Effective from 2017, an obligation to prepare a three-tiered standardized transfer-pricing documentation is introduced. The required transfer-pricing documentation is determined by the size of the taxpayer (measured by the total revenues or total costs) in the year preceding the given tax year. The following is the required documentation: • Below EUR2 million: no documentation prepared upfront is required. • Between EUR2 million and EUR10 million: local documentation file with extended scope is required. The documentation should include, among other items, a business description (organizational or management chart, business strategy and competitors) and a description of compliance of transactional terms with market conditions (in practice, justification of arm’s-length character). • Between EUR10 million and EUR20 million: local documentation file including comparative analyses reflecting local market conditions to support the arm’s-length character of the transactional prices applied is required, as well as a supplement to the annual corporate income tax return, which is a simplified report on transactions with the related parties (CIT-TP). • Between EUR20 million and EUR750 million: the documentation mentioned in the preceding bullet plus Masterfile documentation. • Above EUR750 million: the documentation mentioned in the preceding bullet plus Country-by-Country Reporting (CbCR). Documentation must be also prepared for the year following the year in which the obligation exists, even if the size of taxpayer does not meet the above criteria. For transactions with tax havens, the obligation to prepare transferpricing documentation exists if the transaction amount exceeds EUR20,000. Thresholds for each documented transaction or event depends on the size of the company (measured by its total revenues or total costs). The following are the thresholds: • Between EUR2 million and EUR20 million: the documentation threshold amounts to EUR50,000, plus EUR5,000 for each additional EUR1 million of revenue or costs above EUR2 million. • Between EUR20 million and EUR100 million: the documentation threshold amounts to EUR140,000 (plus EUR45,000 for each additional EUR10 million of revenue or costs above EUR20 million). • Above EUR100 million: the documentation threshold amounts to EUR500,000. During tax audits, authorities can ask for documentation of other transactions; taxpayers have 30 days to submit this documentation. The documentation obligation applies to the following: • Regular transactions • Liquidity management, joint ventures, consortiums and similar enterprises (the EUR 50,000 threshold applies) • Other events (business restructurings) No documentation requirement applies if public regulators set the prices. The documentation must be in Polish. Taxpayers must submit a signed declaration confirming that local transfer-pricing documentation is in place at the date on which the annual corporate income tax return is filed. Taxpayers must present transfer-pricing documentation within seven days after the date of the request of the tax authorities. If the tax authorities assess additional income to a taxpayer and if a taxpayer does not provide the transfer-pricing documentation required by the law, additional income that is assessed in connection with intercompany transactions that are not covered with the documentation is taxed at a penalty tax rate of 50%. The transfer-pricing documentation requirements applicable to Polish entities also apply to permanent establishments of foreign residents located in Poland and to permanent establishments of Polish entities. In addition, if income earned by the permanent establishment of a foreign resident is reassessed in Poland and if no transfer-pricing documentation is submitted by the statutory deadline, a corporate income tax rate of 50% can be applied to any additionally reassessed income. The Advanced Pricing Agreement (APA) regulations entered into force on 1 January 2006.

Effective from 2015, it is possible to eliminate double taxation in domestic transactions. Under a draft law, CbCR in certain cases and notification requirements will also apply to Polish subsidiaries and permanent establishments, with 2016 as the first reporting year. The standard withholding tax rates are 19% for dividends and 20% for interest and royalties. The rate may be reduced under a double tax treaty on presentation of a certificate of tax residence or, in some cases, under domestic regulations.

The documentation should include, among other items, a business description (organizational or management chart, business strategy and competitors) and a description of compliance of transactional terms with market conditions (in practice, justification of arm’s-length character). • Between EUR10 million and EUR20 million: local documentation file including comparative analyses reflecting local market conditions to support the arm’s-length character of the transactional prices applied is required, as well as a supplement to the annual corporate income tax return, which is a simplified report on transactions with the related parties (CIT-TP). • Between EUR20 million and EUR750 million: the documentation mentioned in the preceding bullet plus Masterfile documentation. • Above EUR750 million: the documentation mentioned in the preceding bullet plus Country-by-Country Reporting (CbCR). Documentation must be also prepared for the year following the year in which the obligation exists, even if the size of taxpayer does not meet the above criteria. For transactions with tax havens, the obligation to prepare transferpricing documentation exists if the transaction amount exceeds EUR20,000. Thresholds for each documented transaction or event depends on the size of the company (measured by its total revenues or total costs). The following are the thresholds: • Between EUR2 million and EUR20 million: the documentation threshold amounts to EUR50,000, plus EUR5,000 for each additional EUR1 million of revenue or costs above EUR2 million. • Between EUR20 million and EUR100 million: the documentation threshold amounts to EUR140,000 (plus EUR45,000 for each additional EUR10 million of revenue or costs above EUR20 million). • Above EUR100 million: the documentation threshold amounts to EUR500,000.

Also, penalties from the Penal Fiscal Code may be applied. The transfer-pricing documentation requirements applicable to Polish entities also apply to permanent establishments of foreign residents located in Poland and to permanent establishments of Polish entities. In addition, if income earned by the permanent establishment of a foreign resident is reassessed in Poland and if no transfer-pricing documentation is submitted by the statutory deadline, a corporate income tax rate of 50% can be applied to any additionally reassessed income. Also, penalties from the Penal Fiscal Code may be applied. The APA regulations entered into force on 1 January 2006. An APA concluded for a particular transaction is binding on the tax authorities with respect to the method selected by the taxpayer. APAs may apply to transactions that have not yet been executed or transactions that are in progress when the taxpayer submits an application for an APA. In June 2006, Poland ratified the EU convention on the elimination of double taxation in connection with the adjustment of profits of associated enterprises (90/436/EEC). Effective from 2015, it is possible to eliminate double taxation in domestic transactions. Polish headquarters with consolidated revenues (as defined in the Accounting Act) in Poland and outside of Poland that exceeded in the previous fiscal year the equivalent of EUR750 million must file a CbCR report within 12 months after the end of the reporting year of the group. The first reporting year is 2016. In addition, Polish law includes a secondary filling mechanism (under this mechanism, if no agreement on the exchange of tax information exists between two given countries and if no other entity from the group is responsible for the preparation of a CbCR report, the Polish tax authorities may request the Polish entity to prepare a CbCR report). Polish subsidiaries are required to file with the Head of Tax Administration a notification on which entity within the group is responsible for CbCR preparation. Such notification should be filed by the end of the financial year (the exceptional deadline for the 2016 fiscal year was 10 months from the year-end). Financial penalties up to an amount of PLN1 million can be imposed for not fulfilling reporting obligations. These penalties can be imposed on the entities belonging to the group that, despite the obligation to submit the CbCR report, failed to do so, provided incomplete information or did not send a notification. Under the Fiscal Penal Code, a fine of up to 240 daily rates (the daily rate is calculated based on the minimum wage in force in Poland on the day on which a penalty is imposed) may be imposed on entities acting on behalf of or in the taxpayer’s interest that submit false information about entities that are part of a group. The standard withholding tax rates are 19% for dividends and 20% for interest and royalties. The rate may be reduced under a double tax treaty on presentation of a certificate of tax residence or, in some cases, under domestic regulations. Poland ratified the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (Multilateral Instrument or “MLI”), which may modify the application of Polish double tax treaties in the future. The following table shows the withholding tax rates under Polish double tax treaties without taking into account the impact of the MLI.

POL,2019,Poland,transfer pricing,"Transfer pricing. The Polish tax law includes specific rules on transfer pricing. Effective from 2017, fundamental changes were introduced regarding the obligations and scope with respect to transfer-pricing documentation, followed by changes effective from 2019. The main rules, which are based on the OECD guidelines, are contained in the Corporate Income Tax Act and the Personal Income Tax Law. Several Decrees of the Ministry of Finance and official announcements of the Ministry of Finance were published to provide details regarding the wording of the law. Effective from 2019, the definition of related parties is changed significantly. The amended law broadens the scope of entities that may fall within this definition and incorporates additional anti-abuse rules. The amended law has removed the relations resulting from employment from the definition. Under the Corporate Income Tax Act, the following entities are considered to be related parties: • An entity and at least one other entity over which it exercises significant influence • A natural person, including a spouse or a relative to the second degree of relation and an entity, and an entity over which he or she exercises significant influence • An entity that exercises significant influence over a company without legal personality and such company and its partners • The taxpayer and its permanent establishment, and in the case of a tax capital group, a capital company belonging to the group and its permanent establishment Under the amended law, parties whose relations are held or established without business justification, including relations aimed at the manipulation of the ownership structure or the creation of circular ownership structures, are treated as related parties. The following is considered to be significant influence: • Owning directly or indirectly at least 25% of shares in capital, the voting rights for the control of the managing authorities of the company or shares or rights for participation in profits, property or expectative, including participation units and investment certificates • The actual ability of a natural person to influence the key business decisions undertaken by a legal person or an organizational unit without legal personality • Being married or being relative to the second degree In 2019, the catalog of the transfer-pricing methods is revised and extended. The tax law provides for the following traditional transfer-pricing methods: • The comparable uncontrolled price method (preferable one) • The resale-price method • The cost-plus method (significant change of the definition aligning it with the OECD definition) If the above methods are inapplicable, the transactional methods (profit-split method and transactional net margin method) can be considered. If neither the traditional methods nor the transactional ones can be used, other methods may be applied, including valuation techniques. A Decree of the Ministry of Finance provides further details on the application of the valuation techniques for transferpricing purposes. The revised Corporate Income Tax Act also incorporates new rights of the tax authorities to reclassify or not recognize a transaction under several conditions. The Polish Decrees on transfer pricing also provide detailed rules regarding the preparation of comparability analyses as well as business restructurings. Effective from 2017, an obligation to prepare a three-tiered standardized transfer-pricing documentation was introduced. It is amended from 2019, with the following main changes: • Documentation thresholds for controlled transactions were changed. Depending on the type of transaction, the thresholds are PLN2 million or PLN10 million. For transactions with tax havens, the obligation to prepare transfer-pricing documentation exists if the transaction amount exceeds PLN100,000. • The threshold requiring entities to have Master File documentation was changed. The Master File should be provided within 12 months after the end of the tax year, provided that consolidated financial statements are prepared by the group, that the group has generated consolidated revenues exceeding PLN200 million and that the Polish entity is required to prepare Local File documentation. • The threshold for the preparation of benchmarking analyses was removed. Benchmarking analyses covering comparable data and selection process should also be available in electronic form. They need to be revised every three years, or earlier in the case of significant change of the market conditions. • Some types of controlled transactions are excluded from the documentation requirement. • Safe harbors for selected service transactions and loans are introduced. • The scope of Local File and Master File documentation was revised. • A tax return on transfer pricing (TPR) is introduced, replacing the CIT TP return. It requires taxpayers to report significant amount of information regarding intragroup relations, including the description of transfer-pricing methods. The Local File documentation must be prepared in Polish. However, the Master File may be provided in English (during a tax audit, the tax authorities may request that the taxpayer to translate the Master File within 30 days). Taxpayers must submit a signed declaration confirming that local transfer-pricing documentation is in place and that the transferpricing policy used conforms with the arm’s-length principle within nine months after the end of the tax year. The statement needs to be signed by members of the management board and cannot be provided by the proxy. Lack of declaration or the filling of an untrue declaration is penalized based on the Penal Fiscal Code. The taxpayer may opt to follow the new rules binding from 2019 for their documentation for 2018. Taxpayers must present transfer-pricing documentation within seven days after the date of the request of the tax authorities. If the tax authorities assess additional income to a taxpayer realizing intragroup transactions, the additional tax liability is calculated by the tax authorities to be a value of 10% of the additional income reassessed. The value of the additional tax liability is doubled if a taxpayer does not provide the transfer-pricing documentation required by the law or provides documentation that is incomplete or if the additional income reassessed exceeds a value of PLN15 million. If both of these conditions are fulfilled, the additional tax liability is tripled. Penalties for lack of documentation or incomplete documentation are not applied if the taxpayer supplements the documentation within 14 days. Penalties from the Penal Fiscal Code may be applied. The APA regulations entered into force on 1 January 2006. An APA concluded for a particular transaction is binding on the tax authorities with respect to the method selected by the taxpayer.

POL,2021,Poland,transfer pricing,"Transfer pricing. The Polish tax law includes specific rules on transfer pricing. Effective from 2017, fundamental changes were introduced regarding the obligations and scope with respect to transfer-pricing documentation, followed by changes effective from 2019. The main rules, which are based on the OECD guidelines, are contained in the Corporate Income Tax Act and the Personal Income Tax Law. Several Decrees of the Ministry of Finance and official announcements of the Ministry of Finance were published to provide details regarding the wording of the law. Effective from 2019, the definition of related parties is changed significantly. The amended law broadens the scope of entities that may fall within this definition and incorporates additional anti-abuse rules. The amended law has removed the relations resulting from employment from the definition. Under the Corporate Income Tax Act, the following entities are considered to be related parties: • An entity and at least one other entity over which it exercises significant influence • A natural person, including a spouse or a relative to the second degree of relation and an entity, and an entity over which he or she exercises significant influence • An entity that exercises significant influence over a company without legal personality and such company and its partners • The taxpayer and its permanent establishment, and in the case of a tax capital group, a capital company belonging to the group and its permanent establishment Under the amended law, parties whose relations are held or established without business justification, including relations aimed at the manipulation of the ownership structure or the creation of circular ownership structures, are treated as related parties. The following is considered to be significant influence: • Owning directly or indirectly at least 25% of shares in capital, the voting rights for the control of the managing authorities of the company or shares or rights for participation in profits, property or expectative, including participation units and investment certificates • The actual ability of a natural person to influence the key business decisions undertaken by a legal person or an organizational unit without legal personality • Being married or being a relative to the second degree In 2019, the catalog of the transfer-pricing methods was revised in that methods are now considered equal. The tax law provides for the following transfer-pricing methods: • The comparable uncontrolled price method • The resale-price method • The cost-plus method (significant change of the definition aligning it with the OECD definition) • The transactional net margin method • The profit-split method If none of the above methods can be used, other methods may be applied, including valuation techniques. A Decree of the Ministry of Finance provides further details on the application of the valuation techniques for transfer-pricing purposes. The revised Corporate Income Tax Act also incorporates new rights of the tax authorities to reclassify or not recognize a transaction under several conditions. The Polish Decrees on transfer pricing also provide detailed rules regarding the preparation of comparability analyses as well as business restructurings. Effective from 2017, an obligation to prepare a three-tiered standardized transfer-pricing documentation was introduced. It is amended from 2019, with the following main changes: • Documentation thresholds for controlled transactions were changed. Depending on the type of transaction, the thresholds are PLN2 million or PLN10 million. For transactions with tax havens (from 2020, including a situation in which the ultimate beneficiary is located in a tax haven), the obligation to prepare transfer-pricing documentation exists if the transaction amount exceeds PLN100,000. • The threshold requiring entities to have Master File documentation was changed. The Master File should be provided within 12 months after the end of the tax year, provided that consolidated financial statements are prepared by the group, that the group has generated consolidated revenues exceeding PLN200 million and that the Polish entity is required to prepare Local File documentation. • The threshold for the preparation of benchmarking analyses was removed. Benchmarking analyses covering comparable data and selection process should also be available in electronic form. They need to be revised every three years, or earlier in the case of significant change of the market conditions. • Some types of controlled transactions are excluded from the documentation requirement. • Safe harbors for selected service transactions and loans are introduced. • The scope of Local File and Master File documentation was revised. • A tax return on transfer pricing (TPR-C) is introduced, replacing the CIT TP return. It requires taxpayers to report a significant amount of information regarding intragroup relations, including the categories of transfer-pricing methods and the profitability achieved on the transactions and how it corresponds to the benchmarking results. The Local File documentation must be prepared in Polish. However, the Master File may be provided in English (during a tax audit, the tax authorities may request that the taxpayer to translate the Master File within 30 days). Taxpayers must submit a signed declaration confirming that local transfer-pricing documentation is in place and that the transferpricing policy used conforms with the arm’s-length principle within nine months after the end of the tax year. The statement needs to be signed by members of the management board and cannot be provided by the proxy. Lack of declaration or the filing of an untrue declaration is penalized based on the Penal Fiscal Code. The Master File needs to be prepared (not provided) within 12 months from year-end. The above deadlines were extended by three months for 2019 only as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Taxpayers must present transfer-pricing documentation within seven days after the date of the request of the tax authorities. If the tax authorities assess additional income to a taxpayer realizing intragroup transactions, the additional tax liability is calculated by the tax authorities to be a value of 10% of the additional income reassessed. The value of the additional tax liability is doubled if a taxpayer does not provide the transfer-pricing documentation required by the law or provides documentation that is incomplete or if the additional income reassessed exceeds a value of PLN15 million. If both of these conditions are fulfilled, the additional tax liability is tripled. Penalties for lack of documentation or incomplete documentation are not applied if the taxpayer provides the documentation within 14 days. Penalties from the Penal Fiscal Code may be applied. The APA regulations entered into force on 1 January 2006 and were changed in 2019. An APA concluded for a particular transaction is binding on the tax authorities with respect to the method selected by the taxpayer. APAs may apply to transactions that have not yet been executed or transactions that are in progress when the taxpayer submits an application for an APA. In June 2006, Poland ratified the EU convention on the elimin­ ation of double taxation in connection with the adjustment of profits of associated enterprises (90/436/EEC). Effective from 2015, it is possible to eliminate double taxation in domestic transactions. Polish headquarters with consolidated revenues (as defined in the Accounting Act) in Poland and outside of Poland that exceeded in the previous fiscal year the equivalent of EUR750 million must file a CbCR report within 12 months after the end of the reporting year of the group. The first reporting year was 2016. In addition, Polish law includes a secondary filling mechanism (under this mechanism, if no agreement on the exchange of tax information exists between two given countries and if no other entity from the group is responsible for the preparation of a CbCR report, the Polish tax authorities may request the Polish entity to prepare a CbCR report). Polish subsidiaries are required to file with the Head of Tax Administration a notification on which entity within the group is responsible for CbCR preparation. Such notification should be filed by the end of the financial year (the exceptional deadline for the 2016 fiscal year was 10 months from the year-end). Financial penalties up to an amount of PLN1 million can be imposed for not fulfilling reporting obligations. These penalties can be imposed on the entities belonging to the group that, despite the obligation to submit the CbCR report, failed to do so, provided incomplete information or did not send a notification. Under the Fiscal Penal Code, a fine of up to 240 daily rates (the daily rate is calculated based on the minimum wage in force in Poland on the day on which a penalty is imposed) may be imposed on entities acting on behalf of or in the taxpayer’s interest that submit false information about entities that are part of a group. The standard withholding tax rates are 19% for dividends and 20% for interest and royalties. The rate may be reduced under a double tax treaty on presentation of a certificate of tax residence or, in some cases, under domestic regulations. Poland ratified the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (Multilateral Instrument or “MLI”), which may modify the application of Polish double tax treaties starting from 1 January 2019. The following table shows the withholding tax rates under Polish double tax treaties without taking into account the impact of the MLI.

Major Russian taxpayers can enter into advance pricing agreements. A Russian party to a controlled transaction also has the right to make a corresponding adjustment of the transfer price if the other party voluntarily made an adjustment. To guarantee the automatic exchange of financial account information between the Russian Federation and its foreign counterparts, effective from 1 January 2018, requirements for Country-by-Country Reporting (CbCR) apply to multinational groups of companies and requirements apply to financial market companies for the supply information on their clients in a Common Reporting Standard (CRS) format.

SAU,2019,Saudi Arabia,transfer pricing,"Transfer pricing. The GAZT has announced the implementation of transfer-pricing regulations in Saudi Arabia and published the draft of such regulations, which are elaborated in bylaws to the Saudi Arabia income tax law, for public consultations (the transfer-pricing bylaws). The transfer-pricing bylaws contain mandatory legislative provisions regarding transactions among related parties and documentation requirements following the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Action 13 standard. They also prescribe transfer-pricing methods and establish other administrative procedures, including related-party disclosure forms. The table below shows the withholding rates for dividends, interest and royalties provided under Saudi Arabia’s double tax treaties that are in force and effective as of 1 January 2019. Certain other tax-exempting provisions (for example, for sovereign wealth funds) are contained in certain protocols to Saudi tax treaties. To benefit from the reduced rates or exemptions under double tax treaties, additional conditions must be met (for example, the recipient is required to be the beneficial owner of the related gain). Readers should seek professional advice with respect to the application of Saudi tax treaties. The treaty benefits are not applicable automatically and should be claimed from the GAZT in each case by submitting the Q7-B form and other supporting documents (for example, tax residence certificate). The taxpayer may claim the treaty benefit up front and follow double tax treaty rules, or the taxpayer may pay the tax under domestic income tax law and then claim a refund from the GAZT.

SEN,2019,Senegal,transfer pricing,"Transfer pricing. The Senegalese tax law contains specific transferpricing documentation requirements. Transactions between associated enterprises must be documented. Such documentation must include at a minimum a description of the terms of the trans­ actions, the entities involved, a functional analysis and a detailed description of the chosen methodology to determine the applied transfer prices. The documentation must establish how transfer prices were determined and whether the terms of the intercompany transactions would have been adopted if the parties were unrelated. If such information is not available on request in an audit or a litigation, the tax authorities may assess the taxable income based on information at their disposal. The concerned companies do not have to automatically file the transfer-pricing documentation. They must make it available to the National Directorate of Taxes and Domains (Direction Générale des Impôts et Domaines), which is empowered to request such documentation within the framework of an accounts examination procedure (field audit of the company). Failure to provide such documentation triggers a penalty of 0.5% of the value of transactions for which supporting documentation has not been provided to the National Directorate of Taxes and Domains or completed on its request. The 2018 tax reform implemented the following two new transfer-pricing reporting obligations: • Transfer pricing annual report • Country-by-Country Report (CbCR) Transfer pricing annual report. Companies meeting the conditions listed below should file by 30 April of the year following the tax year a transfer-pricing report containing general and specific information on the group of companies and the reporting entity, such as the following: • Transaction values • General description of the activities • General description of the transfer-pricing policy of the group • Information on loans, borrowings and other transactions realized with related entities The filing is mandatory for entities meeting one of the following conditions: • Turnover, excluding taxes or gross assets, equal to XOF5 billion or more • Holding, at the end of the tax year, directly or indirectly, more than half of the share capital or voting rights of a company, located in Senegal or abroad, that generates turnover, excluding taxes, or holds gross assets equal to XOF5 billion or more • More than half of its share capital or voting rights is held by a company generating turnover, excluding taxes, or holds gross assets equal to XOF5 billion or more Failure to submit the transfer-pricing report triggers a fiscal fine of XOF10 million. CBCR. Multinational enterprises (MNEs) meeting the reporting conditions must electronically submit a CbCR. Under the regulation, all Senegal tax resident constituent entities that are Ultimate Parent Entities (UPEs) of an MNE group with annual consolidated group revenue equal to or exceeding XOF491 billion (approximately EUR750 million) must prepare a CbCR for tax years starting on or after 1 January 2018. Any other constituent entity of the MNE group that is tax resident in Senegal must prepare and submit the CbCR if the UPE is not resident in Senegal and if any of the following conditions are met: • The Senegalese tax resident company has been elected by the MNE group to file a CbCR and has informed the Senegalese tax administration. • The Senegalese tax resident company fails to provide evidence that another company of the MNE group (based in Senegal, in a country that has implemented a similar CbCR requirement or in a jurisdiction that has concluded with Senegal a qualified exchange of information instrument) has been designated for purposes of filing the CbCR. • Senegal has been notified regarding a systematic failure to exchange the information. Notwithstanding the above, a consistent entity in Senegal is not required to file a CbCR if a Surrogate Parent Entity (SPE) is appointed in Senegal or in another jurisdiction that has entered into a qualifying information exchange instrument with Senegal for purposes of filing the CbCR. A failure to comply with the CbCR rules is punishable by a fine of XOF25 million (approximately USD27,700).

On 23 February 2006, the Singapore Revenue issued Transfer-Pricing Guidelines to assist companies in Singapore with the management or elimination of the risk of double taxation. The Guidelines are consistent with the arm’s length principle outlined in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Transfer-Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations and serve as a starting point for framing the Singapore Revenue’s expectations for related-party dealings. Under the Guidelines, no formal requirements are imposed on companies to prepare transfer-pricing documentation. However, the Singapore Revenue expects companies to assess their transferpricing risk and prepare transfer-pricing documentation commensurate with that risk. In general, withholding tax at a rate of 15% is imposed on interest and other payments with respect to loans or indebtedness paid to nonresidents. However, interest paid by approved banks in Singapore on deposits held by nonresidents is exempt from tax if the nonresidents do not have a permanent establishment in Singapore and do not carry on business in Singapore by themselves or in association with others. In addition, tax exemption also applies to interest paid on certain qualifying debt securities issued before 31 December 2008 to nonresidents who do not have a permanent establishment in Singapore. The exemption also applies to nonresidents who have a permanent establishment in Singapore, but do not use the funds obtained from the operations of the permanent establishment to acquire the debt securities. A 10% withholding tax is imposed on the following types of payments to nonresidents: royalties for the use of, or the right to use, intangible property; and payments for the use of, or the right to use, scientific, technical, industrial or commercial knowledge or information. A 15% withholding tax is imposed on rent and other payments to nonresidents for the use of movable property. Payments made to nonresident professionals for services performed in Singapore are subject to a final withholding tax of 15% on their gross income, unless the nonresident professionals elect to be taxed at 20% of net income. In general, a 20% withholding tax is imposed on payments to nonresidents for assistance or services rendered in connection with the application or use of scientific, technical, industrial or commercial knowledge or information, and for management or assistance in the management of any trade, business or profession. Under a 2007 budget proposal, the withholding tax rate for such payments due and payable on or after 1 January 2007 is generally reduced to 18%. However, the rate remains at 20% for payments made to nonresident individuals or Hindu joint families (a Hindu joint family includes all persons lineally descended from a common ancestor [including their wives and unmarried daughters] and a co-parcenary; for Singapore income tax purposes, a Hindu joint family is regarded as a separate taxable entity). Payments for services performed wholly outside Singapore are exempted by concession. For management fees paid to a nonresident related party, this concession applies only if the fees represent a pure cost reimbursement without any mark-up. Tax treaties may override the above withholding tax rules. Singapore does not levy a withholding tax on dividends (see Section B).

ESP,2011,Spain,transfer pricing,"Transfer pricing. Spanish law includes the arm’s length principle and the requirement of documenting all related-party transactions. The arm’s length principle applies to all transactions carried out by taxpayers with related parties. The following are the principal aspects of the law: • Taxpayers must use arm’s length values in their tax returns. As a result, taxpayers bear the burden of proof on transfer-pricing issues. • Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) guidelines and pricing methodology apply. • The law provides for secondary adjustments. Under this measure, if the agreed value in a transaction differs from the normal market value, the difference between the values is recharacterized by following a substance-over-form approach. In particular, for a transaction between a company and a shareholder, the difference (proportionally to the participation in the entity) is con - sidered a dividend if such difference is in favor of the share - holder or a contribution by the shareholder to the entity’s equity if the difference is in favor of the entity. • Advance Price Agreements (APAs) may be negotiated. They apply to the current year, the preceding year and the following four years. • Statutory documentation requirements in line with the guidelines of the EU Joint Transfer Pricing Forum entered into force on 19 February 2009.

ESP,2015,Spain,transfer pricing,"Transfer pricing. Spanish law includes the arm’s-length principle and the requirement of documenting all related-party transactions. The arm’s-length principle applies to all transactions carried out by taxpayers with related parties. The following are the principal aspects of the law: • Taxpayers must use arm’s-length values in their tax returns. As a result, taxpayers bear the burden of proof on transfer-pricing issues. • OECD guidelines and pricing methodology apply. • The law provides for secondary adjustments. Under this measure, if the agreed value in a transaction differs from the normal market value, the difference between the values is recharacterized by following a substance-over-form approach. In particular, for a transaction between a company and a shareholder, the difference (proportionally to the participation in the entity) is considered a dividend if such difference is in favor of the shareholder or a contribution by the shareholder to the entity’s equity if the difference is in favor of the entity. • Advance Price Agreements (APAs) may be negotiated. They apply to the current year, the preceding year and the following four years. Effective from 1 January 2015, the law allows APAs to have retroactive effect within the statute-of-limitations period. • Statutory documentation requirements in line with the guidelines of the EU Joint Transfer Pricing Forum entered into force on 19 February 2009. This documentation is required to support the taxpayer’s transfer-pricing policy regarding domestic and in ternational transactions. • Penalties and delay interest may be imposed. If the documentation is correct, the tax authorities do not impose a penalty with respect to a transfer-pricing assessment. However, the absence (or incompleteness) of documentation is subject to penalties, even if no adjustments are assessed. The new Spanish Corporate Income Tax Act provides the following three exceptions to the obligation to prepare statutory transferpricing documentation: • When the transaction takes place between entities that form part of a Spanish tax consolidated group • When the transaction is carried out between members of an Economic Interest Grouping (Agrupaciones de Interés Económico) or a Temporary Business Alliance (Uniones Temporales de Empresas) • When the transaction is carried out within the scope of a public stock offering • When transactions with the same entity do not exceed EUR250,000 per year Effective from 1 January 2015, simplified documentation requirements apply to entities that are not members of the same mercantile group and whose turnover does not exceed EUR45 million. For the 2012, 2013 and 2014 tax years, total transactions with the same entity not exceeding EUR100,000 per year do not need to be documented if the company is deemed a “small or medium-sized enterprise.” Some specified transactions must be documented in any case, such as transactions performed with group “related parties” that are tax resident in a tax-haven jurisdiction. Article 18.2 of the Spanish Corporate Income Tax Act provides a definition of “related parties.” In addition, transactions performed with related or unrelated residents of listed tax havens must comply with the arm’s-length principle and are subject to statutory documentation requirements. The rates reflect the lower of the treaty rate and the rate under domestic tax law.

ESP,2018,Spain,transfer pricing,"Transfer pricing. Spanish law includes the arm’s-length principle and the requirement of documenting all related-party transactions. The arm’s-length principle applies to all transactions carried out by taxpayers with related parties. The following are the principal aspects of the law: • Taxpayers must use arm’s-length values in their tax returns. As a result, taxpayers bear the burden of proof on transfer-pricing issues. • OECD guidelines and pricing methodology apply. • The law provides for secondary adjustments. Under this measure, if the agreed value in a transaction differs from the normal market value, the difference between the values is recharacterized by following a substance-over-form approach. In particular, for a transaction between a company and a shareholder, the difference (proportionally to the participation in the entity) is considered a dividend if such difference is in favor of the shareholder or a contribution by the shareholder to the entity’s equity if the difference is in favor of the entity. • Advance Price Agreements (APAs) may be negotiated. They apply to the current year, the preceding four years and the following four years. The law allows APAs to have retroactive effect within the statute-of-limitations period. • Statutory documentation requirements in line with the guidelines of the EU Joint Transfer Pricing Forum entered into force on 19 February 2009. This documentation is required to support the taxpayer’s transfer-pricing policy regarding domestic and in ternational transactions. • Penalties and delay interest may be imposed. If the documentation is correct, the tax authorities do not impose a penalty with respect to a transfer-pricing assessment. However, the absence (or incompleteness) of documentation is subject to penalties, even if no adjustments are assessed. The Spanish Corporate Income Tax Act provides the following three exceptions to the obligation to prepare statutory transferpricing documentation: • When the transaction takes place between entities that form part of a Spanish tax consolidated group • When the transaction is carried out between members of an Economic Interest Grouping (Agrupaciones de Interés Económico) or a Temporary Business Alliance (Uniones Temporales de Empresas) • When the transaction is carried out within the scope of a public stock offering • When transactions with the same entity do not exceed EUR250,000 per year Simplified documentation requirements apply to entities with a turnover that does not exceed EUR45 million, computed at the level of the mercantile group. Some specified transactions must be documented in any case, such as transactions performed with group “related parties” that are tax resident in a tax-haven jurisdiction. Article 18.2 of the Spanish Corporate Income Tax Act provides a definition of “related parties.” In addition, transactions performed with related or unrelated residents of listed tax havens must comply with the arm’s-length principle and are subject to statutory documentation requirements. New Country-by-Country (CbC) Reporting obligations apply to Spanish tax resident groups if the consolidated group’s net turnover in the immediately preceding fiscal year exceeded EUR750 million. This obligation may also apply in certain cases to subsidiaries of foreign groups.

From the 2020 fiscal year, profit-seeking enterprises can conduct one-off transfer-pricing adjustments if they are carried out prior to the end of the year and meet the relevant required criteria. As outlined in the regulation, the relevant duties and taxes (for example, customs duty, value-added tax, commodity tax and withholding tax) are paid or refunded based on the adjusted transfer price.

A company with controlled transactions of TZS10 billion (approximately USD4,300,000) or more in a tax year is required to file contemporaneous transfer-pricing documentation together with the final tax return. Taxpayers whose controlled transactions in a tax year do not reach the TZS10 billion threshold do not have to submit the contemporaneous transfer-pricing documentation with the final income tax return but must have it in place by the due date for filing the final income tax return and should submit it to the Tanzania Revenue Authority within 30 days on request. A penalty is imposed for failure to prepare contemporaneous transfer-pricing documentation. The penalty is a minimum of 3,500 currency points, as prescribed from time to time by the Commissioner General for the Tanzania Revenue Authority.

THA,2021,Thailand,transfer pricing,"Transfer pricing. Under transfer-pricing guidelines issued by the Thai Revenue Department, all sales or service transactions must be executed at an arm’s-length price, and the taxpayer is required to prepare and maintain contemporaneous documentation to substantiate the price. Acceptable transfer-pricing methods include the comparable uncontrolled price method, the resale price method, the cost-plus method and other internationally accepted methods. If the taxpayer fails to prove that a transaction challenged by the tax authorities was executed on an arm’s-length basis, additional tax can be assessed. Transactions between related parties are sub­ ject to particular scrutiny. In addition, new Thailand transfer-pricing provisions under the Thai tax code are effective from accounting years starting on or after 1 January 2019. The following are key features of the new transfer-pricing provisions: • The tax authorities are granted the authority to assess additional revenue and/or expenses on transactions between related parties, for the purpose of calculating corporate income tax or adjusting assessable income. • Regardless of having related-party transactions or regardless of the length of the relationship during the accounting period, related parties must prepare a report providing descriptions of the related-party relationships and disclosing the related parties and the value of related-party transactions for each accounting period in accordance with the specified format and submit the form to the tax authorities within 150 days from the closing date of the accounting period. Taxpayers with annual revenue of less than THB200 million are exempt from the requirement to prepare and submit a report. • Within five years from the date of filing the report, the tax authorities with the approval of the Director-General of the Revenue Department can request additional documents or evidence necessary to analyze the related-party transactions. The taxpayer is required to submit the additional documents within 60 days after receiving a request letter.

For the purpose of determining the tax due by resident or established enterprises in Tunisia that are dependent on or control other enterprises belonging to the same group, the profits indirectly transferred to such enterprises either by raising or lowering the prices of transactions, or by any other means, are incorporated into the results of these enterprises.

UKR,2013,Ukraine,transfer pricing,"Transfer pricing. New transfer-pricing rules are effective from 1 January 2013. Transfer-pricing rules apply to barter transactions, related-party transactions (both domestic and cross-border), and transactions with nonresidents and other persons that are not regular CPT payers. For tax purposes, prices in controlled transactions must be at arm’s length. A 20% deviation from arm’s length prices is allowed. Arm’s length prices can be established by the following transferpricing methods: • Compared uncontrolled price • Resale-minus • Cost-plus • Transaction net margin method • Profit-split If none of these methods can be applied, an arm’s length price can be determined by a certified evaluator. Only official sources of information can be used to determine arm’s length prices. Transfer-pricing rules do not apply to prices regulated or established by the government (except for cases in which the government establishes a minimal price) and prices determined through tenders. For products imported into Ukraine, the arm’s length price cannot be lower than the customs value of the imported products. The burden of proof that the actual contract prices are not at an arm’s length rests on the tax authorities. If a deviation from arm’s length prices is proved, the tax authorities can adjust the tax liabilities of the taxpayer and apply penalties. If the taxpayer challenges such decisions of the tax authorities, the tax authorities must apply to the court to proceed with the tax adjustment. Large taxpayers may apply to State Tax Service of Ukraine for an advance pricing agreement. No transfer-pricing documentation requirement is imposed in Ukraine. Further developments in Ukrainian transfer pricing are expected in 2013. Ukraine honors the double tax treaties of the former USSR, except for treaties that have been superseded by new treaties concluded directly by Ukraine or renounced by the other party to the treaty. Ukraine is not a member of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). As a result, the Ukrainian tax authorities may not follow commentary of the OECD model convention.

UKR,2014,Ukraine,transfer pricing,"Transfer pricing. Effective from 1 September 2013, new transferpricing rules took effect in Ukraine. Transactions with the following counterparties fall under transferpricing control: • All nonresident related parties. • Related parties that are tax residents of Ukraine and that meet one of the following criteria: — They are loss-making companies. — They are not regular CPT or VAT payers or pay these taxes at a lower rate. — They use the single tax or agricultural tax regimes. • Residents (including unrelated parties) of “low-tax” jurisdictions where a nominal or effective CPT rate is at least 5% below the Ukrainian CPT rate. The list of low-tax jurisdictions is approved by the Ukrainian government and comprises 74 states (including, Cyprus, Ireland and Switzerland). A transaction with the above counterparties is subject to transferpricing control if the annual amount of all transactions with the same counterparty reaches UAH50 million (USD6,250,000). The Tax Code provides for the following five methods for determining the arm’s-length price for controlled transactions: • Compared uncontrolled price (the preferred method) • Resale-minus • Cost-plus • Transactional net margin • Profit-split Special rules apply to the export and import of certain commodities (including oil and gas, metals, chemicals and grain) until 2018. Taxpayers that perform controlled transactions must file a transfer-pricing report by 1 May of the year following the reporting year. Failure to submit the report is subject to a penalty amounting to 5% of all controlled transactions. Large taxpayers may apply for advance pricing agreements. Ukraine honors the double tax treaties of the former USSR, except for treaties that have been superseded by new treaties concluded directly by Ukraine or renounced by the other party to the treaty.

UKR,2016,Ukraine,transfer pricing,"Transfer pricing. Effective from 1 January 2015, new transferpricing rules took effect in Ukraine. Additional changes were made in mid-2015. Under the transfer-pricing rules, controlled transactions include the following: • Transactions with nonresident related parties. • Transactions with nonresidents registered in low-tax jurisdictions and jurisdictions with which Ukraine has not entered into treaties on exchange of information. The government approves the list of such jurisdictions. • Commission sales through nonresident commissioners. • Transactions between related parties through unrelated intermediaries that do not undertake significant functions, use significant assets or assume significant risk. The above-mentioned transactions are controlled if both of the following circumstances exist: • The annual taxable profit of the taxpayer exceeds UAH50 million (approximately USD1,900,000). • The amount of such annual transactions with each entity exceeds UAH5 million (approximately USD190,000). The Tax Code provides for the following five methods for determining the arm’s-length price for controlled transactions: • Compared uncontrolled price (the preferred method) • Resale-minus • Cost-plus • Transactional net margin • Profit-split Special rules apply to exports or imports of quoted goods. These rules previously applied only to transactions with nonresidents registered in low-tax or non-transparent jurisdictions. However, they now apply to all export and import transactions involving quoted goods. The following transactions are deemed to be at arm’s length: • Transactions with state-regulated prices • Transactions for which appraisal is mandatory • Transactions for which an auction (public bidding) is mandatory • Forced sales of collaterals Taxpayers that perform controlled transactions must file a transferpricing report by 1 May of the year following the reporting year. Beginning on this date, the tax authorities may request transferpricing documentation for some or all of the controlled transactions. This documentation must be submitted within one month after the date of receipt of the request. The statute of limitations for transfer-pricing purposes is currently seven years.

The government approves the list of such jurisdictions. • Commission sales of goods and services through nonresident commissioners. • Transactions involving goods and services between related parties through unrelated intermediaries that do not undertake significant functions, do not use significant assets and do not assume significant risks. • Transactions with nonresidents that do not pay corporate profit tax, or are exempt from this tax and/or are not tax residents of the country where they are registered as legal entities. The government shall approve the list of legal forms of such nonresidents of such countries. The above-mentioned transactions are controlled if both of the following circumstances exist: • The annual income of the taxpayer exceeds UAH150 million (approximately USD5,500,000). • The amount of such annual transactions with each entity exceeds UAH10 million (approximately USD370,000). The Tax Code provides for the following five methods for determining the arm’s-length price for controlled transactions: • Compared uncontrolled price (the preferred method) • Resale price • Cost-plus • Transactional net margin • Profit-split Specific profit-level indicators are assigned to each TP method. Special rules apply to exports or imports of quoted goods. Taxpayers that perform controlled transactions must file a TP Report (report on controlled transactions) by 1 October of the year following the reporting year. TP documentation must be submitted within 30 calendar days after the date of receipt of the request. The statute of limitations for TP purposes is currently seven years. Ukraine honors the double tax treaties of the former USSR, except for treaties that have been superseded by new treaties concluded directly by Ukraine or renounced by the other party to the treaty. Ukraine is not a member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). As a result, the Ukrainian tax authorities are not bound by the commentary of the OECD model convention. The rates in the following table reflect the lower of the treaty rate and the rate under domestic tax law for dividends, interest and royalties paid from Ukraine to residents of treaty countries.

The most recent changes were adopted on 16 January 2020 but at the time of writing, they were not yet in effect (see Section G). Under the current TP rules, controlled transactions include the following: • Transactions with nonresident related parties. • Transactions with nonresidents registered in low-tax and nontransparent jurisdictions. The government approves the list of such jurisdictions. • Commission sales of goods and services through nonresident commissioners. • Transactions involving goods and services between related parties through unrelated intermediaries that do not undertake significant functions, do not use significant assets and do not assume significant risks. • Transactions with nonresidents that do not pay corporate profit tax, or are exempt from this tax and/or are not tax residents of the country where they are registered as legal entities.

The abovementioned transactions are controlled if both of the following circumstances exist (for transactions between a nonresident and its PE only the second circumstance needs to exist): • The annual income of the taxpayer exceeds UAH150 million (approximately USD6,100,000). • The amount of such annual transactions with each entity exceeds UAH10 million (approximately USD407,000).

Special rules apply to exports or imports of quoted goods. Taxpayers that perform controlled transactions must file a TP Report (report on controlled transactions) by 1 October of the year following the reporting year. TP documentation must be submitted within 30 calendar days after the date of receipt of the request. The statute of limitations for TP purposes is currently seven years. Ukraine honors the double tax treaties of the former USSR, except for treaties that have been superseded by new treaties concluded directly by Ukraine or renounced by the other party to the treaty. Ukraine is not a member of the Organsiation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). As a result, the Ukrainian tax authorities are not formally bound by the commentary of the OECD model convention; however, Ukrainian tax authorities and Ukrainian courts often rely on OECD commentary. The rates in the table below reflect the lower of the treaty rate and the rate under domestic tax law for dividends, interest and royalties paid from Ukraine to residents of treaty jurisdictions. Exceptions or conditions may apply, depending on the terms of the particular treaty. Beneficial ownership and tax residency tests, as well as additional eligibility conditions, must be met to apply reduced withholding tax rates under the double tax treaties.

Ukraine has signed an amending protocol with the Netherlands, but the protocol is still pending ratification. The parliament of Ukraine has voted for ratification of protocols changing the double tax treaties with Singapore, Switzerland and Turkey. The protocols will enter into force on completion of ratification formalities. The Minister of Finance has been authorized to sign a new treaty with Spain and a treaty with Sri Lanka. Ukraine is negotiating double tax treaties with Guinea, New Zealand and Tunisia and an amendment to its double tax treaty with Belgium. On 23 May 2020, changes embodied in the Law No.466-IX took effect (except for certain provisions taking effect on 1 July 2020 and 1 January 2021). Therefore, the rules in effect as of 1 January 2020, which are described in Sections A through F of this chapter, should be reconsidered in view of the changes contained in this new law. Also, it is expected that some of the new rules may be rediscussed and potentially detailed, changed and/or postponed. Key changes in the new law are discussed below.",7183,FALSE,yes,yes,Lower income,1,0
UKR,2021,Ukraine,transfer pricing,"Transfer pricing. Transfer pricing (TP) rules have been effective in Ukraine since 2013. Ukrainian TP regulations are frequently changed. Under the current TP rules, controlled transactions include the following: • Transactions with nonresident related parties. • Transactions with nonresidents registered in low-tax and nontransparent jurisdictions. The government approves the list of such jurisdictions. • Commission sales of goods and services through nonresident commissioners. • Transactions involving goods and services between related parties through unrelated intermediaries that do not undertake significant functions, do not use significant assets and do not assume significant risks. • Transactions with nonresidents that do not pay corporate profit tax, or are exempt from this tax and/or are not tax residents of the country where they are registered as legal entities. The government approves the list of legal forms of such nonresidents of such countries. • Transactions between a nonresident and its PE in Ukraine. • Transfer of functions, together with assets, risks and benefits to a related party, if the transfer results in a decrease of a taxpayer’s income and/or financial result, regardless of whether the transaction is recorded in accounting. The abovementioned transactions are controlled if both of the following circumstances exist (for transactions between a nonresident and its PE only the second circumstance needs to exist): • The annual income of the taxpayer exceeds UAH150 million (approximately USD5,328,000). • The amount of such annual transactions with each entity determined in line with the arm’s-length principle exceeds UAH10 million (approximately USD355,000). The Tax Code provides for the following five methods for determining the arm’s-length price for controlled transactions: • Compared uncontrolled price (the preferred method) • Resale price • Cost-plus • Transactional net margin • Profit-split Specific profit-level indicators are assigned to each TP method. Special rules apply to exports or imports of quoted goods. Taxpayers that perform controlled transactions must file a TP Report (report on controlled transactions) by 1 October of the year following the reporting year. TP documentation must be submitted within 30 calendar days after the date of receipt of the request. The statute of limitations for TP purposes is currently seven years. Starting in the 2020 reporting year, a notification on participation in a multinational group of companies should be filed together with the report on controlled transactions. Starting in the 2021 reporting year, three-tiered TP reporting applies to qualifying cases. This reporting consists of a master file, TP documentation (a local file) and a country-by-country report. Ukraine honors the double tax treaties of the former USSR, except for treaties that have been superseded by new treaties concluded directly by Ukraine or renounced by the other party to the treaty. Ukraine is not a member of the Organsiation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). As a result, the Ukrainian tax authorities are not formally bound by the commentary of the OECD model convention; however, Ukrainian tax authorities and Ukrainian courts often rely on OECD commentary. The rates in the table below reflect the treaty rates for dividends, interest and royalties paid from Ukraine to residents of treaty jurisdictions. Exceptions or conditions may apply, depending on the terms of the particular treaty. Beneficial ownership and tax residency tests, as well as additional eligibility conditions, must be met to apply reduced withholding tax rates under the double tax treaties. The recently enacted tax reform law has detailed the “beneficial owner” condition, and introduced the “principal purpose test” and “look through” concept into national law. Ukraine has ratified the Multilateral Instrument (MLI) and deposited its final positions with the OECD. On 1 December 2019, the MLI entered into force for Ukraine. The impact of the MLI on the text of Ukrainian treaties (including the date of its entry into effect for a particular treaty) should be analyzed on a caseby-case basis.

USA,2021,United States,transfer pricing,"Transfer pricing. In general, the IRS may redetermine the tax lia­ bility of related parties if, in its discretion, this is necessary to prevent the evasion of taxes or to clearly reflect income. Specific regulations require that related taxpayers (including US persons and their foreign affiliates) deal among themselves on an arm’slength basis. Under the best-method rule included in the transferpricing regulations, the best transfer-pricing method is the one that provides the most reliable measure of an arm’s-length result, determined based on the facts and circumstances. Transferpricing methods that may be acceptable, depending on the circumstances, include the comparable profits method, comparable uncontrolled price method, cost-plus method, resale price method and profit-split method. It is possible to reach transferpricing agreements in advance with the IRS. If the IRS adjusts a taxpayer’s tax liability, tax treaties between the United States and other countries usually provide mutual agreement procedures for the allocation of adjustments between related parties in the two countries to avoid double tax.

VNM,2021,Vietnam,transfer pricing,"Transfer pricing. The Vietnamese transfer-pricing regulations apply the arm’s-length principle to determine transfer prices of business transactions undertaken between related parties and is broadly consistent with the arm’s-length concept as set out in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations (OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines). The applicable transfer-pricing methods under the Vietnamese transfer-pricing regulations closely resemble the methods provided by the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines and include the following: • Comparable uncontrolled price method • Resale price method • Cost-plus method • Profit-split method • Comparable profit method (referred to as the transactional net margin method in the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines) The Vietnamese regulations contain detailed transfer-pricing documentation requirements. The documentation must be prepared before the submission of the annual income tax return to substantiate the arm’s-length prices and submitted to the tax authority within a prescribed time limit on receipt of written request in a tax audit. Advance pricing agreement (APA) regulations are largely in line with the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines and APA regimes in other tax jurisdictions.

This group includes the following types of transactions: — Transactions of large taxpayers — Transactions related to sale or purchase of strategic goods from the list to be approved by the government of Belarus The following transactions are excluded from the list of controlled transactions: • Transactions for which the price is established by international treaties of Belarus • Bank operations (according to the list established by the Banking Code of Belarus) • Operations with securities and derivatives on the organized securities market The comparability of prices to market prices is reviewed only for the purpose of calculating corporate profits tax, and the prices are adjusted only if this will increase the tax. The following methods are used to determine for tax purposes the conformity of transaction prices to market prices: • Comparable market price method • Resale price method • Cost-plus method • Comparable profits method • Profit-split method Domestic law does not contain requirements for taxpayers to prepare and submit specific notifications regarding controlled transactions. However, effective from 1 July 2016, all VAT payers will be required to prepare and submit electronic invoices for VAT purposes through the web portal of the Ministry of Taxes and Duties of Belarus. The form of the VAT invoice will include, among other items, fields on whether a taxpayer’s counterparty is a related party, an offshore zone resident or one of the large taxpayers, and on whether a transaction is connected with the sale or purchase of strategic goods. Consequently, by means of electronic VAT invoices, the tax authorities will receive information on the controlled transactions of a taxpayer on a real-time basis. On a specific request of the tax authorities, a taxpayer must prepare and submit documentation proving that the prices set in the controlled transactions are at market level. The Tax Code provides for the following two types of documentary confirmation for transfer-pricing purposes (specific requirements for each type are set out in the Tax Code): • Documentation for large cross-border transactions (see above) • Confirmation of the economic feasibility of applied prices for all other types of controlled transactions The documentation package must be submitted within the number of days prescribed in the tax authorities’ request. However, such term may not be less than the following: • Ten working days from the date of receipt of notification under a desk tax audit • Five working days from the date of receipt of notification under a field tax audit Belarus has entered into double tax treaties with Armenia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belgium, Bulgaria, China, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Egypt, Estonia, Finland, Georgia, Germany, Hungary, India, Iran, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Kazakhstan, Korea (North), Korea (South), Kyrgyzstan, Kuwait, Laos, Latvia, Lebanon, Lithuania, Macedonia, Moldova, Mongolia, the Netherlands, Oman, Pakistan, Poland, Qatar, Romania, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Switzerland, Syria, Tajikistan, Thailand, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan, Venezuela, Vietnam and Yugoslavia (applied to Serbia). Belarus has also signed double tax treaties with Indonesia and Libya, but these treaties have not yet entered into force.

The arm’s-length principle for cross-border payments made between affiliated entities, and payments made to entities located in a country with a privileged tax regime applies in Madagascar. Taxpayers subject to corporate income tax should electronically file transfer-pricing documentation (Master File and Local File in French or Malagasy languages) at the same time as the corporate income tax return. Taxpayers should also readjust the taxable profits when filing the corporate income tax return if the transfer prices charged on cross-border transactions do not comply with the arm’s-length principle.
