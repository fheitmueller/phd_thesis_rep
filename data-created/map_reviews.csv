DEU,stage-2,[C.3],"While Germany has significantly reduced the average  completion time of MAP cases in 2017 as compared to  2016, resulting in an average for 2017 below 24 months  (which is the pursued average for resolving MAP cases  received on or after 1 January 2016) and for both years  combined is almost below this average, there is still  a risk that post-2015 cases are not resolved within  the average of 24 months. This in particular regards  attribution/allocation cases, for which the average  timeframe is 31.62 months and which may indicate that  the competent authority is not adequately resourced.  For these cases, the main issues identified by peers  were delays in communication, specifically the issuing  of position papers and responses to position papers  and delays caused in the context of the close working  relationship with the tax administrations of the Länder in  handling and resolving MAP cases. Furthermore, as the MAP caseload relating to  other cases has increased from 1 January 2016 to  31 December 2017, this indicates that at least until 2017  the competent authority may not have been adequately  resourced to cope with this increase, although several  actions have been taken to address this in the meantime.","While since 1 January 2016 Germany has added  a substantial number of new staff to the competent  authority function, has increased the number of face- to-face meetings and communications with its treaty  partners, Germany should closely monitor whether the  addition of resources recently provided and foreseen will  be sufficient to ensure a timely, effective and efficient  resolution of MAP cases. It this would not be the case,  Germany should, in particular for attribution/allocation  cases, hire or assign more staff to its competent  authority, such also with a view to ensuring that delays  in the co-ordination between the Federal Central Tax  Office and the tax administrations of the Länder can  be avoided, that delays in providing position papers  and responses to position papers can be avoided,  and to enable Germany’s competent authority to  more frequently liaise with treaty partners’ competent  authorities.",2020,resources_MAP_function

Further, peers observed a lack of clarity as to the  personnel competent to make decisions within  Kazakhstan’s competent authority (Including a frequent  change in personnel) and suggested that the staff in  its competent authority function are not provided the  mandate to negotiate MAP cases. Therefore, there is a risk that pending post-2015 cases  will in the future not be resolved within the pursued  average of 24 months and this might indicate that  resources are not adequately made available for  Kazakhstan’s competent authority.","Kazakhstan should ensure that resources are made  available for the competent authority function in a way  that allows an adequate use of such resources for  the resolution of MAP cases in a timely, efficient and  effective manner.
