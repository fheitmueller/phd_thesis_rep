Although the Brazilian tax authorities have not yet provided any guidance, this increase would potentially also apply to capital gains realized by nonresi- dent companies and individuals because they are generally subject to the same taxation as the taxation applicable to Brazilian individuals. The effective date established by Law 13,259 is 1 January 2016, as stated in PM 692. However, as a result of constitutional issues, the increase should not apply until 1 Jan- uary 2017.
