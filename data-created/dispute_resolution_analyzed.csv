However, for practical reasons, we permit an APA to start on the 1st day of the financial year, even though transactions already took place between the first day of the financial year and the date of submission, on the understanding that the application is submitted at the latest on the last day of that financial year. When the relevant facts and circumstances are identical as those in previous tax years, the taxpayer can ask for a roll-back.

When the relevant facts and circumstances are identical as those in previous tax years, the taxpayer can ask for a roll-back. In that case, the outcome of the APA could also be applied for the previous years. Roll-back can only be permitted if the applicable time limits (such as the tax assessment terms) allow this. For Belgium this means that roll-back can be applied provided that the relevant facts and circumstances of the previous years are identical AND the tax assessment terms for those years are not expired yet.","http://finances.belgium.be/sites/default/

Likewise, through sentence No. TC/0315/15, dated September 25 of 2015, the Constitutional Court has pronounced the Reciprocity Principle as follows: “On the subject of international agreements or treaties, the reciprocity principle, as said by the Colombian court, “alludes to the correspondence that must exist between two States”. Likewise, regarding the equality principle, it is useful to remember that the moment in which a State is ready to enter an agreement with another State, it must warn that one of the purposes that sponsor the promotion of international relations is that both nations, both contracting parties, obtain, with equal conditions -or in the other case, in reasonably similar or balanced conditions, as many obligations as benefits.”","Dominican Republic Constitution promulgated

Previous German guidance suggested that waiving the right to request MAP could be appropriate in certain situations. The now revised guidance, since April 2017, no longer suggests waiving the right to request MAP. It does however suggest that it is appropriate to conclude so-called “agreements on facts” (in German: “tatsächliche Verständigung” between a taxpayer and a German local tax office only in connection with a waiver of the right to request arbitration in relation to the contents of the “agreement on facts”.

In this regard, it is F clarified that concerning MAP requests filed by taxpayers in respect of actions of one or both of Indonesia and/or the treaty partner (whether concerning transfer pricing adjustments or other actions) result or will result for the taxpayer in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of the tax treaty, Indonesia’s competent authority would grant access to MAP where the conditions specified in the provision concerning access to MAP in the relevant tax treaty (in most cases, equivalent to or based on Article 25(1) of the OECD Model Tax Convention), as interpreted in the Commentary, are met. It is further clarified that any discretion exercised by Indonesia’s competent authority pursuant to Article 2(2) and (3) of Regulation No. 16/PJ/2020 in respect of MAP requests filed concerning actions of Indonesia would only be for the determination of whether the objection raised in the MAP request is justified or not. urther, Article 8 of Indonesia’s MAP guidance deals with withdrawal of a MAP request and in addition to rules governing how a taxpayer may withdraw a filed MAP request, this provision also grants Indonesia’s competent authority the power to withdraw the MAP request during discussions by notifying the concerned taxpayer and the competent authority of the treaty partner. In this regard, it is clarified that Indonesia's competent authority would only allow this provision to be applied by competent authorities for MAP cases that are initiated by the competent authority itself, under the equivalent of Article 25(3) of the OECD Model in the concerned tax treaty, and not for MAP cases arising from a taxpayer request. All MAP requests initiated by the taxpayer may only be withdrawn by the taxpayer itself.","MAP Information & Guidance:

yes,"Under Article 50 of the Income Tax Law promulgated by the Law No. 21 of 2009, the Tax Department (TD) may refuse the benefit that the taxpayer has obtained because of arrangements, operations or transactions, if the taxpayer enters into these arrangements or carries on these operations with the main purpose of avoiding the payment of the tax due. The TD may, in any of the instances stated above, take all or some of the following measures: - the application of the arm's length value to an economic act or transaction subjected, by the taxpayer, to a different value; or - the adjustment of the amount of the tax due by the taxpayer or any other person involved in the arrangement, operation or transaction provided for above. In accordance with Article 53 of the Executive Regulations of the Income Tax Law issued by Resolution No. 10 of 2011 of the Minister of Economy and Finance, the evasion of the payment of the due tax, under Article 50 of the Income Tax Law means, in particular, the execution, by the taxpayer, of agreements, operations or transactions, one of the main purposes of which is to reduce the amount of the taxable income, or to create or to increase a loss. In applying the provisions of Article 50 of the Income Tax Law, the tax advantage includes, among other things, the reduction of the due tax through the reduction of the taxable income. The agreements, operations and transactions provided for in Article 50 of the Income Tax Law are, particularly the agreements, operations and transactions that include commercial and financial conditions between related parties that are different from those applicable between unrelated parties. A person is deemed to be associated with another person when one of them holds, independently or with another person or associated persons, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the capital, voting rights or income rights of the other person, or when another person or associated person owns, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the capital, voting rights or income rights, in both persons. The market price in case of full competition under Article 50 of the Income Tax Law shall be specified according to the free comparative price, which is the price of a service or commodity that would have been applied if the transaction had taken place between unrelated parties. This price must be specified on the basis of a comparison with a similar commodity or service delivered or rendered between unrelated parties, paying particular attention to the following: - The attributes of the commodity or service; - The terms of the contract; - The functions performed, the assets used and the risks incurred; - The economic conditions. When the data necessary for the application of the free reference comparative price are not available, the taxpayer shall submit a request to the TD to apply one of the other pricing processes approved by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The laconic provisions of the last paragraph of Article 53 call for an effort of clarification, with regard to the bilateral Advanced Pricing Arrangements programs (APA programs). For the purposes of the last paragraph of Article 53, Qatar intends to further clarify the bilateral APA programs for controlled operations, based on the guidelines of the OECD on transfer pricing (TP) for multinational enterprises (MNEs) and tax administrations, including the appropriate criteria on the basis of which transfer prices will be determined.",-,2,QAT,2018-07-09,2018,bil_apa_available,,bp,[B.P.1],preventing_disputes,10,69,1

A taxpayer-initiated foreign adjustment will be considered bona fide where it reflects the good faith effort of the taxpayer to report correctly the taxable income from a controlled transaction or the profits attributable to a PE, and where the taxpayer has otherwise timely and properly fulfilled all of its obligations related to such taxable income or profits under the tax laws of the two Contracting Parties.",-,14,QAT,2018-07-09,2018,access_taxpayer_adjustment,,bp,[B.P.6],availability_access,10,69,1

In Saudi Arabia, in addition to the Mutual Agreement I W Procedure (MAP) under tax treaties, there are two domestic recourses to solve tax disputes between taxpayers and the tax administration. The two domestic recourses are the Settlement Committee and the General Secretariat of Tax Violations and Disputes Resolution Committees, the latter being the judicial recourse. n order for the Settlement Committee to process a taxpayer’s request, the taxpayer has to suspend or freeze the process of the case at any other recourse, i.e. the judicial recourse or the MAP. The Settlement Committee’s decision is not binding. If the taxpayer does not accept the proposed resolution, he may resume any other available recourse. ith respect to the relation between the MAP and the two domestic recourses, a MAP process can be initiated simultaneously alongside domestic recourses. However, if a taxpayer makes a MAP request for a case being considered at a domestic recourse, the taxpayer has to request a freeze or suspension of the case at the relevant domestic recourse in order for the case to be reviewed by the MAP Competent Authority.

This includes cases relating to economic double taxation. Under a MAP, Singapore will make a corresponding adjustment if Singapore agrees that a primary transfer pricing adjustment should be made by the other jurisdiction under Article 9(1) of the OECD Model Tax Convention or the UN Model Taxation Convention, notwithstanding the absence of Article 9(2).","P

yes,"H Almost all of the tax treaties the Netherlands entered into include the equivalent of the second sentence of article 25(2) OECD Model Convention, concerning the implementation of a mutual agreement reached notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic law of the contracting states. For these treaties MAP agreements will be implemented regardless of the domestic statute of limitation of five years. owever, some treaties do not contain this second sentence. This concerns tax treaties with Austria, Brazil, Canada, the Czech Republic, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Korea, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, Nigeria, Philippines, Singapore, the Slovak Republic, Spain, Surinam, Tajikistan, Thailand and Former Republic of Yugoslavia. 8 For these treaties, where the tax assessment concerned has already become final once the Netherlands competent authority enters into a MAP-agreement, paragraph 6.2 of the Decree on mutual agreement procedures of 11 June 2020 (no. 2020-0000101607) and article 17(16) of the Decree on administrative tax law of 18 December 2013 (BLBK2013/995M) allows the tax inspector to implement such agreement regardless of the domestic statute of limitation of five years.","Available at:
